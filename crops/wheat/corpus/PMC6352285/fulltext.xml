We hypothesized that the addition of &#x003b2;-glucan, a dietary fiber, and tea polyphenols to a food matrix like bread will also affect starch digestion in the upper gut and thus further influence colonic fermentation and SCFA production. This study investigated SCFA and PA production from locally developed breads: white bread (WB), black tea bread (BT), &#x003b2;-glucan bread (&#x003b2;G), &#x003b2;-glucan plus black tea bread (&#x003b2;GBT). Each bread was incubated in an in vitro system mimicking human digestion and colonic fermentation. Digestion with &#x003b1;-amylase significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) increased total polyphenol and polyphenolic metabolites from BT bread compared with WB, &#x003b2;G, and &#x003b2;GBT. Total polyphenols in &#x003b2;GBT remained higher (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016; 1.3-fold) after digestion with pepsin and pancreatin compared with WB.

This study suggests that combination of black tea with &#x003b2;-glucan in this functional bread did not impact on SCFA production.

Introduction</title><p>The gut microbiota is sustained by non-digested or non-absorbed food components. Two of the key food constituents metabolized by the colonic bacteria are dietary fiber and plant polyphenols. Some starch also escapes digestion and is available for fermentation in the colon. Starch digestion could be influenced by the food matrix including dietary fiber. It is important to understand the impact of combining food ingredients in functional foods on the supply of nutrients to the colonic microbiota and the subsequent production of bioactive molecules including short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and phenolic acids (PA).</p><p>Starch and gluten are key components in bread that undergo physicochemical changes during the bread making process [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Bread is commonly consumed in Western countries and can be manipulated for further development of functional properties [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The addition of soluble fiber such as guar gum (galactomannan) to bread reduced in vitro starch hydrolysis (approximately 31% against control wheat bread) by preventing starch-&#x003b1;-amylase interactions [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Our previous findings demonstrated that incorporating &#x003b2;-glucan into bread could help &#x02018;preserve&#x02019; the starch granules compared with normal wheat bread [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The presence of &#x003b2;-glucan conserved the starch structure and/or reduced the surface area for &#x003b1;-amylase-starch interaction. These contributed to reduced starch hydrolysis which could increase delivery of substrate to the colon for the gut microbiota.</p><p>&#x003b2;-Glucan is a soluble dietary fiber with mixed &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;3) and &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4) glucosidic linkages. Four gram of &#x003b2;-glucan per 30 g available carbohydrate has been approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to reduce the glycemic response without disproportionally increasing the postprandial insulinemic response [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studies have shown that puddings and snack bars prepared with &#x003b2;-glucan positively reduced post-prandial glycemic (17% versus control) and insulin concentrations (27% versus control) [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mechanistically, low and high molecular weight &#x003b2;-glucan are fermented by the intestinal microbiota, resulting in production of the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate, and butyrate [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Propionate acts as a precursor in hepatic glucose production and is involved in appetite regulation through the stimulation of hepatic nerves [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The consumption of inulin propionate ester (10 g/day) in healthy humans increased fullness by 14%, when compared with an inulin control [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the dose (10 g/day) used in this study was very high and is not attainable from normal dietary intake. The question remains on how to increase the level of propionate in our body or whether the presence of another bioactive component such as polyphenols can synergistically increase the health benefit of &#x003b2;-glucan.</p><p>Polyphenols found in foods such as fruits, vegetables, tea, and coffee are important bioactive compounds associated with beneficial health effects such as reduction in blood pressure [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], cardiovascular risk factors [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Polyphenols in fruits, vegetables, or cereals are usually located in the plant cell walls or bound within the food matrix which reduces their bioavailability [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, polyphenols in beverages such as black tea are more &#x02018;readily&#x02019; available and can be used in formulations together with &#x003b2;-glucan. Black tea is an ideal choice for testing synergistic effects of fiber and polyphenols because of its wide consumption. The average black tea consumption in Europe is four cups/day (1000 mL) in males and three cups/day (865 mL) in females [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Acute black tea intake (250 mL) containing 350 mg total polyphenols reduced postprandial glycaemia by 52% in a randomized-crossover human intervention [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An in vivo animal study suggested that black tea (5 mg/kg body weight) reduced glucose levels when compared with a drug (acarbose) commonly used for type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment (T2DM) [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mechanistically, the presence of bioactive polyphenols inhibited &#x003b1;-amylase and/or &#x003b1;-glucosidase enzymic activity and therefore the glycemic response blunts [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The health benefits of black tea are due to the presence of small and large molecular weight polyphenols [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Black tea is rich in quercetin (10&#x02013;25 mg/L), kaempferol (7&#x02013;17 mg/L), and myricetin (2&#x02013;5 mg/L) and high molecular weights theaflavins (TF) and thearubigins (TR) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. TF and TR are responsible for the pigments of black tea, derived by enzymatic oxidation during tea fermentation [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These large complexes are poorly digested and most tea polyphenols escape to the colon where they are metabolized by the gut bacteria. In humans, tea flavan-3-ols reached the colon (50&#x02013;70% of ingested dose) after drinking a cup (300 to 500 mL) of green tea [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The polyphenols may be further metabolized into SCFA by the gut microbiota. Unno and Osakabe demonstrated that 10 g/kg black tea extract increased caecal propionate production in rats compared with green tea and the control [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Food components (e.g., fiber, polyphenols) can interact in several ways when eaten as a separate meal, but if combined in the same food matrix in foodstuffs such as bread that are heavily transformed during food processing, these interactions may be more complex. Tea polyphenols can interrupt amylose recrystallisation that results in a more rigid structure more resistant to enzymatic action [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Soluble &#x003b2;-glucan addition to a polyphenol containing food matrix has the potential to &#x02018;trap&#x02019; high molecular weight black tea polyphenols within the starch granules to form a complex and substrate for colonic bacteria fermentation. We aimed to investigate the effects of combining black tea and &#x003b2;-glucan in a food matrix on polyphenol release and SCFA production in an in vitro model mimicking human digestion and fermentation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-16-00227"><title>2.

One portion of black tea (BT) bread (111 g) and &#x003b2;-glucan plus black tea (&#x003b2;GBT) bread (153 g) provided 30% of polyphenols that could be obtained from a cup (250 Ml) of black tea [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of combining &#x003b2;-glucan and black tea in a food matrix (bread) to determine if there was a synergistic impact on total polyphenol and SCFA production by gut microbiota in an in vitro model of digestion and fermentation mimicking the human large intestine. In vitro digestion of BT bread with &#x003b1;-amylase increased polyphenol content and antioxidant potential compared with WB and &#x003b2;GBT breads. Tea polyphenols and high amylose maize starch form polyphenols-amylose complexes following thermal treatment [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The tea polyphenol-amylose complex modified the normal amylose retrogradation (re-crystalline) to a low-ordered crystalline structure. In another study, the addition of tea polyphenols (16%, <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> basis) prevented starch retrogradation [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Amylose and tea polyphenols are rich in hydroxyl groups, these hydrogen bonds govern the interaction between starch and tea polyphenols during gelatinization [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, in our study, black tea was added to the bread mix. This will have different food matrix effects due to mixing, proofing, and baking. In previous studies, the addition of polyphenol extracts and pectin influenced the cross-linking of gluten leading to more water retention and changes in texture (softer bread) [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore we hypothesized that adding black tea polyphenols to the bread mix will interact with gluten forming cross-links and a softer bread, which could expose starch granules to &#x003b1;-amylase activity and increased antioxidant potential of BT bread. On the other hand, in &#x003b2;GBT bread system, the interaction is much more complex than BT because of a food-matrix interaction between gluten, &#x003b2;-glucan, and black tea polyphenols. Simonsen et al. showed that tea polyphenols had the ability to form complexes with soluble &#x003b2;-glucan through hydrogen bonding [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This was further confirmed in an in vitro model system where the adsorption capacity of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major tea polyphenol, in the presence of &#x003b2;-glucan was clearly governed by hydrogen bonding [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. According to this we expect that black tea polyphenols could form complexes with the gluten-network while &#x003b2;-glucan &#x02018;preserves&#x02019; the starch structure for digestion by &#x003b1;-amylase. In our experiment, total polyphenols and antioxidant activity of &#x003b2;GBT remained higher compared with WB in an in vitro model mimicking small intestine enzymic digestion and absorption. The presence of polyphenols is of interest as they may be further metabolized by the colonic microbiota to phenolic acids [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, a limitation of our study is the use of a simple in vitro total polyphenol method suitable for estimation of &#x02018;crude&#x02019; polyphenols [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A more detailed analysis of phenolic acids using LC-MS would have provided a more comprehensive polyphenol profile.</p><p>In a human study where ileostomists ingested 452 &#x003bc;mol flavan-3-ols (from tea), it was shown that a large proportion (up to 73%) of flavan-3-ols pass from the small intestine to the colon [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Tea polyphenols are metabolized by colonic bacteria in the colon into SCFA and phenolic acids before being further metabolized in the liver or excreted [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The human gut microbiota metabolized tea polyphenols to 3-(3&#x02032;-hydroxyphenyl)propionic and 3-(4&#x02032;-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acids [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Liu et al. showed that gut microbiota degraded epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate and subsequently reduced their bioavailability [<xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the bioactivity of these phenolics acids in human health remains unknown and needs further investigation. Unno and Osakabe demonstrated that black tea supplementation in rats significantly reduced the relative abundance of <italic>Clostridium</italic> subcluster XIVa and <italic>Clostridium</italic> cluster XI compared with control [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that methylated (&#x02212;)-epigallocatechin-3-<italic>O</italic>-(3-<italic>O</italic>-methyl) gallate (main component of tea polyphenols) reduced the <italic>Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio in an experimental rat [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Still, it is still unknown whether the (polyphenol-linked &#x003b2;-glucan will be undigested and enter the large intestine to be metabolized by the bacteria to SCFA. To answer this question, the fermentability of the breads was investigated using an in vitro human colonic fermentation model.</p><p>This study showed that acetate and propionate were similar in the fermentation medium containing &#x003b2;G and &#x003b2;GBT compared to WB. Propionate production with &#x003b2;G was 17.5 mM and for &#x003b2;GBT 18.6 mM, with an acetate:propionate:butyrate production ratio of 56:38:6. This was similar to other in vitro studies of &#x003b2;-glucan either from oat or barley [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The propionate was in the range of 5.5&#x02013;18 mM (acetate:propionate:butyrate ratio 51:32:17) considered propionate-rich. A previous study showed 2-fold individual differences in SCFA production [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In our study, donor number 3 consistently showed higher acetate and lower propionate production compared with donors number 1 and 2. This was similar to Harris et al., 2017 [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] who reported inter-individual variations in SCFA (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) with a range of 20 mmol/L to 100 mmol/L from 15 healthy Caucasians.</p><p>We have studied the fermentation of the predigested breads in an in vitro batch culture model, which is well established [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] but has several limitations common to all batch cultures. The products of fermentation are not removed and pH was not controlled, although the pH values reached in our study are representative of those found in the colon after ingestion of fermentable carbohydrates [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Continuous culture models, including a three-stage system representing proximal and distal colon environments [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] may be a better match to the human colon but these are expensive and impractical to use for multiple comparisons of food components. Indeed, most methods currently used have limitations in relation to host functionality [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>An early study by Cummings et al. showed that dietary supplementation does not increase colonic production or circulating level of propionate due to variability in gut microbial activity [<xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Another study showed that an in vitro batch fermentation of inulin-propionate ester increased the microbial activity of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>/<italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Atopobium</italic> cluster compared with baseline (0 h) but did not differ significantly compared with the control (no substrate) and inulin-only control [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Inulin-propionate ester stimulated the release of appetite hormones (GLP-1 and PYY) and subsequently reduced energy intake among obese subjects [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the dose used was much higher than that produced in in vitro studies [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Propionate may activate G protein-coupled receptor 41, on colonic enteroendocrine L-cells [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] which are responsible for secretion of GLP-1 and PYY and may suppress food intake [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, we failed to observe any synergistic effects of adding &#x003b2;-glucan in bread on SCFA production. This lack of effect could be partly explained by the context of the added &#x003b2;-glucan. &#x003b2;-glucan was not shown to increase product viscosity when added to solid food such as bread and biscuits unlike when added to liquid product [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Verbeke et al. using stable isotopes in vivo reported that less propionate was produced from barley kernel than with barley porridge (viscous liquid) [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-00227" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This might be due to the lower water holding capacity of the barley kernel.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-16-00227"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>As expected, this study showed that BT bread had higher antioxidant activity and polyphenol content when digested with &#x003b1;-amylase compared with WB and &#x003b2;G. Antioxidant and polyphenol content of &#x003b2;GBT bread remained higher after in vitro small intestine digestion. &#x003b2;-glucan breads showed higher propionate concentrations at 24 h compared with baseline (0 h) but did not change significantly between breads. Black tea addition with &#x003b2;-glucan had no impact on SCFA production when added in bread. A higher dose of tea and &#x003b2;-glucan or combination with other soluble dietary fibers may be required to impact SCFA production.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the participants.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors contributed towards the design of the experiments; A.M.M.J. performed the experiments and wrote the paper; E.C., C.A.E. and A.L.G. read, edited, and approved the final manuscript.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>A.M.M.J. was funded by Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for a PhD degree at Human Nutrition, University of Glasgow.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-ijerph-16-00227"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosell</surname><given-names>C.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chapter 1&#x02014;The science of doughs and bread quality</article-title><source>Flour and Breads and Their Fortification in Health and Disease Prevention</source><edition>1st ed.</edition><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Preedy</surname><given-names>V.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>R.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>V.B.</given-names></name></person-group><publisher-name>Academic Press</publisher-name><publisher-loc>San Diego, CA, USA</publisher-loc><year>2011</year><fpage>3</fpage><lpage>14</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2-ijerph-16-00227"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hayta</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gamze</surname><given-names>&#x000d6;.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Phytochemical fortification of flour and bread</article-title><source>Flour and Breads and Their Fortification in Health and Disease Prevention</source><edition>1st ed.</edition><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Preedy</surname><given-names>V.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>R.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>V.B.</given-names></name></person-group><publisher-name>Academic Press</publisher-name><publisher-loc>San Diego, CA, USA</publisher-loc><year>2011</year><fpage>293</fpage><lpage>300</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3-ijerph-16-00227"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brennan</surname><given-names>C.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>D.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ellis</surname><given-names>P.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schofield</surname><given-names>J.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of guar galactomannan on wheat bread microstructure and on the in vitro and in vivo digestibility of starch in bread</article-title><source>J.
