Economical and efficient ways are needed to address this problem worldwide. In this regard, exploration and application of proficient microbial strains that can help the crop plants to thrive in agricultural soils that are greatly contaminated with heavy metals. The present study mainly focused on the effect of IAA producing endophytic fungi <italic>Penicillium ruqueforti</italic> Thom., on wheat plants cultivated in soil rich in heavy metals (Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb). <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> has induced great resistance in wheat inoculated plants grown in heavy metal contaminated soil. Application of the isolated strain of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> restricted the transfer of heavy metals from soil to the plants by secreting indole acetic acid (IAA). Furthermore, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> inoculated wheat seedlings watered with waste water had higher plant growth, nutrient uptake and low concentrations of heavy metals in shoot and roots. On the contrary, non-inoculated wheat plants under heavy metal stress had stunted growth with symptoms of chlorosis. From the results, it is concluded that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ruqueforti</italic> inoculation can establish a symbiotic relationship with host plants, which is useful for phytostabilization of heavy metals or in other words helping the host crops to flourish through soil that are highly contaminated with heavy metals.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="22"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript, its Supporting Information files, and NCBI GenBank under Accession number KY173360.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript, its Supporting Information files, and NCBI GenBank under Accession number KY173360.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heavy metal contamination is among one the global challenge and their enhanced concentration poses a significant risks to plants, ecosystem and public health [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, access of heavy metals in soils result in decreased soil fertility that in turn effects plant growth, yield and vigor [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, the development of novel environmental conservation and soil remediation strategies can serve as a paramount in securing healthy environment [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Though, small amounts of heavy metals are obligatory for cellular activities, but its presence in excessive amounts in the environment can be associated with mining, improper handling of industrial wastes, agricultural fertilizers and pesticides [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The heavy metals persist in the soils of industrial areas or other parts with mining facilities and that is why, biological and natural reclamation of such polluted sites are challenging [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In order to clean the soil of such areas, the heavy metal may be extracted through electrochemical methods, thermal processes, washing, stabilization/solidification and burial tie, etc. Though, the methods are sophisticated, but they are quiet expensive to reclaim the soil for crop production purposes [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Keeping feeding of growing population of the world in view, an alternative strategy is demanded to make the heavy metal rich soil fit for crop production. In the current scenario, the use of plant beneficial microorganisms (especially endophytes) that interacts with plants in rhizoshpere and enabling them to alter the uptake, mobility and bioavailabity of metals ion seems the best [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Furthermore, microbial activities inside host roots increases efficiency of metal degradation in contaminated soil through phytostabalization (by reducing the mobility of heavy metals in to the host plants), enhances metal tolerance and biomass production in host plants [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Endophytic microbes (fungi and bacteria) involved in phytoremediation process have shown tremendous potential in improving phytoremediation processes by reducing metal availability, altering soil pH, releasing chelating agents along with multiple enzymatic properties [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

Among the food crops, wheat is unequivocally recognized as a pivotal crop for addressing the growing demands of future world&#x02019;s food supply. At the moment, serious efforts are underway at global level to broaden the genetic base of wheat genotypes through gene stacking and pyramided gene approaches against various biotic and abiotic stresses. Transfer of useful genes is not only time demanding, but extremely expensive and laborious. Besides, mutation within the pathogenic genes due to their rapid evolution overcomes host resistance and renders effectiveness of such introgressed useful genes [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, exploitation of non-conventional approaches, such as the use of endophytic microorganisms for stress management and nutrients availability offers an attractive strategy. Symbiotic-interaction between endophytic fungi and higher plant has been documented in past that clearly defines the role of endophytes in plant host tolerance during stress [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Endophytic fungi may act as a main source to secrete phytohormones and thus enhances the growth of associated plants during stress [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The current work was also focused on the isolation and screening of IAA producing endophytic fungi from the root of halophytic plant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> and its role in stress resistance and growth-promotion of the crop plants under heavy metal stress.</p><p>Initial screening of the endophytic strain revealed a significant increase in the growth of wild maize kernel (<italic>Dek18</italic>) as compared to the&#x02013;ive control that confirmed the presence of phytohormone, IAA. Several researches has supported the symbiotic relationship of endophytic fungi with host plant roots, where host plant can provide shelter to the endophytes and the endophytes in turn release phytoharmones to help the host [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The association of endophytes with host plant will not only help them under normal conditions, but also under high stress conditions, including metal stress. That is the reason, endophytic fungi increases the host plant capacity to hyper accumulate heavy metals by either direct or indirect mechanisms. The endophytes can assist the host plant directly by enhanced mobilization of heavy metals, thus alleviate toxicity level of metals in plants [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], or indirectly by improving plant growth and stress tolerance as observed in the current study. Besides plant growth promoting properties, the endophytes may benefit the host plant by rising its ability to absorb essential nutrients from the contaminated soil [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, endophytes may degrad the pollutants present in the contaminated soil [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and convert them in to a non-toxic form. Here the isolated fungal strain CGF-1 has proved to help the wheat plant under heavy metal stress and alleviate toxicity. Moreover, auxins produced by endophytes can be a contributing factor in host plant development, especially under stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The exogenous supply of the phytohormones by endophytes can bring about positive physiological changes in host plant to stand the stress conditions. In addition to phytohormones, biofertilization ability of endophytic fungi can increase the availability of nutrients to the host plant in heavy metal contaminated soil through solubilization [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Contamination of soil with heavy metals pollutants is mainly attributed to wastewater irrigation [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The result of this study also indicated that concentration of heavy metals like Ni, Cd Cu, Zn, and Pb in soil sample were higher from reference soil and World Health Organization permissible limits. The concentration of heavy metals observed in soil sample treated with waste water in the present experiment is in full agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Correspondingly, the inoculation of CGF-1 had a positive effect on the overall growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments (Chla, Chlb and carotenoids) in inoculated wheat plants under wastewater treatment. Likewise, in osmoregulation of wastewater treatment endophytes can play an important role by stimulating proline production, as it promotes plant growth and avoids metal stress. Proline contents in inoculated plants were higher as compared to non-inoculated plants, which is an indication to avoid stress and toxicity. Endophytic colonization also helped in improving nutrients uptake such as P and N and increased plant productivity [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Among the minerals, the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> was higher in non-inoculated plants as compared to the CGF-1 inoculated plants under salt stress. This might be due to increased absorption of K<sup>+</sup> and restriction of Na<sup>+</sup> by CGF-1 inoculated plants under salt stress. The increased uptake of K<sup>+</sup> leads to a high K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, which is an indication of plant resistance to high salt stress [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>Antioxidant enzymes (APX, CAT, POD and reduced glutathione GSH) can scavenge the accumulated ROS in plants to favor its defense mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Oxidative stress in plants can be recognized by elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APX SOD and reduced glutathione GSH) under stress conditions. So, in the current study, the isolated fungal strain CGF-1 has assisted the wheat plants to produce large amounts of antioxidant enzymes under heavy metal stress. The release of these enzymes scavenged the ROS, thus enable the plant to grow normally under toxic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Besides, the production of antioxidant enzymes, the CGF-1 colonized host plants has reduced the heavy metals uptake and consequently lowered the concentration in shoot and root tissues. The concentration of accumulated metals (Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb) in non-inoculated plants was significantly higher than those having endophytic fungal association. Similar observations concerning the low accumulation of heavy metals in endophyte associated plants have been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0208150.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208150.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Microscopic observation has revealed the presence of inoculated fungus in pericycle and cortex region of the root, which indicates the role of endophytes in metal uptake by host plants. However, further research is required to clarify the detailed mechanisms behind this phenomenon.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study concerning the use of isolated endophytic strain CGF-1 has given promising results in growth promotion of wheat plants under heavy metals stress that limited the absorption of heavy metals by host plants. Furthermore, the inoculated fungus also provided protection to the host plants from heavy metals stress by taking up the heavy metal in fungal mycelium leading to immobilization of metals. Keeping the results of the present study in view, it is highly recommended that similar approaches may be implemented to achieve sustainable agriculture on arid, saline as well as heavy metal contaminated areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec035"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208150.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> plant and endophytic fungus CGF-1.</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208150.g001">Fig 1A</xref> = <italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> plant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208150.g001">Fig 1B</xref> = endophytic fungus CGF-1 isolated from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>surattense</italic> plant and cultured on a Petri plate.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208150.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208150.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignment file of 18S ribosomal DNA region.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208150.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208150.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Endophytic fungal colonization potential in wheat plant tissue.</title><p>(A) Wheat plants inoculated with fungal endophyte strain CGF-1 (B) Inoculated (B1-ive) and non-inoculated wheat plants (B2, B3).
