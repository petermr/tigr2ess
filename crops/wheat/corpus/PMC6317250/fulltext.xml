This review discusses the current state of knowledge of the biofilm mode of growth of these microbiota communities, and how in turn their disruptions may cause disease. Beyond alterations of relative microbial abundance and diversity, the aim of the review is to focus on the disruptions of the microbiota biofilm structure and function, the dispersion of commensal bacteria, and the mechanisms whereby these dispersed commensals may become pathobionts. Recent findings have linked iron acquisition to the expression of virulence factors in gut commensals that have become pathobionts. Causal studies are emerging, and mechanisms common to enteropathogen-induced disruptions, as well as those reported for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and colo-rectal cancer are used as examples to illustrate the great translational potential of such research.

Together, these microorganisms are known as the gut microbiota, although at times, the term microbiota is used to specifically refer to the bacterial communities within this complex consortium. The most recent estimates suggest that the ratio of gut bacterial cells to human body cells is approximately 1 to 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Gut microbiota live in close association with themselves and with the outer layer of the host mucus, as intricate biofilm communities and free-swimming bacteria that disperse from them. The symbiotic relationship between the host and its gut microbiota begins at birth, and is critical to the overall evolutionary fitness and health of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both exogenous as well as endogenous environmental factors are able to modify gut microbiota, and these alterations may in turn lead to detrimental health effects. After elaborating on the biofilm mode of growth of gut microbiota, the present review will focus on how disruptions (&#x0201c;dysbiosis&#x0201d;) within these microbial communities may contribute to enteropathogen-induced disorders, to Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, or to colo-rectal cancer. Microbiota dysbiosis has indeed been linked to a variety of diseases in the gastrointestinal tract as well as in other organs, including the joints, the skin, the eyes, the vasculature, the lungs, and even the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Much needed causal studies on these relationships are found at increasing rates in the scientific literature. Together, these observations indicate that gut commensal microorganisms may become pathobionts. In humans, animals and plants, pathobionts and opportunistic pathogens are known as temporarily benign microbes or commensals that under environmental or host pressure may cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As much as one third of a host&#x02019;s metabolome circulating in its blood comes from a bacterial origin, which sheds light on the great potential for gut microbial commensals and pathobionts to shape homeostatic functions throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While the mechanisms remain largely undefined, this review will present current research findings that are starting to uncover some of these processes.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par3">The well accepted plasticity of the microbiota begs the question of whether the identities of present-day human gut microbial communities originate through inheritance or from environmental pressures. Ground-breaking comparative studies in wild apes, and in humans from Africa or from the Northern hemisphere clearly demonstrate that some of the major families of the gut microbiota have been evolving from common ancestors for more than 15 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since the different species of apes evolved separately from their ancestors, their gut microbiota also diverged and coevolved in parallel, adapting to various environmental factors including diet, gastrointestinal disorders, and habitat, which may in turn have contributed to the significant phyla shifts observed between human gut microbiota of the industrialized World versus those in low income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The plasticity of the gut microbiota is reflected in the significant microbiota dysbiosis observed during a variety of disorders. Hence, environmental factors dominate over genetics in determining gut microbiota, which suggests that similar therapeutic approaches aimed at shaping gut microbiota may be applied across different genetic backgrounds. The explosive growth of data on the assembly and stability of gut microbiota, and on how in turn these may control health and disease is both captivating and daunting. In an attempt to reveal common pathways, this review will focus on how disruptions of microbiota biofilms may lead to post-infectious enteritis disorders, to Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), or to colo-rectal cancer. It has become evident that these emerging views have the potential to revolutionize the development of future therapeutics.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Gut microbiota biofilms</title><p id="Par4">The complex poly-microbial communities of the gut microbiota reside over the intestinal mucus as exopolysaccharide-coated biofilms, that disperse planktonic (free-swimming) bacteria, as they do elsewhere in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The biofilm mode of growth allows to retain water, to protect against antimicrobial substances and enzymes, and facilitates quorum sensing and horizontal gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The biofilm mode of growth in gut microbiota seems to be conserved as the layers of bacteria in the honey bee&#x02019;s ileum are enriched with genes linked to biofilm formation, encoding for type IV pili, motility, flagella, intracellular trafficking, RTX (Repeats-in-Toxins) adhesins, and biofilm-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In disease, combined with disruptions of microbiota biofilm phenotypes and altered metabolomics, planktonic bacteria dispersed from the biofilm communities may become pathobionts in the gut (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In other words, disease may be triggered by the same bacterial species that colonizes healthy individuals. Recent findings offer new insights into how a pro-inflammatory T-cell -mediated response could be restrained by homeostatic commensals, or conversely, triggered by pathobionts. Indeed, in the case of intestinal inflammation driven by <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, this process was found to be regulated by a pathobiont-specific peripherally derived regulatory T cell population called pT<sub>reg</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, it appears that experimental administration of pathobionts may synergize with commensal microbiota to exacerbate pathology, shedding new light on the complexity of how pathobionts may cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The biological significance of the close interactions between gut microbiota biofilms and host mucus is further underscored by the observation that intestinal biofilm bacteria living on mucin differ metabolically and phylogenetically from those living in a planktonic, motile state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Taken together, these observations underscore the importance of characterizing phenotypic and functional alterations of the microbiota biofilms, beyond the routine identifications of relative bacterial abundance and diversity. Moreover, the human gut mucosal microbiota, which interact with the host, differ from the fecal microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. More research is needed to characterize mucosal, rather than fecal, microbiota throughout the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, and their role in health and disease. Recent findings have revealed that colonic mucosal microbiota obtained from human biopsies may be grown as biofilms ex vivo allowing for mechanisitic studies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In rodent models of experimental colitis, microbiota biofilms are fragmented, adhere to epithelial cells, and release invasive bacterial pathobionts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In patients with IBD, gut microbiota biofilm clusters can also be seen adhering tightly to the epithelial surface, obviously having bypassed the mucus barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Bacteria dispersed from microbiota biofilms grown from biopsy tissues of patients with Crohn&#x02019;s Disease or Ulcerative Colitis are able to invade intestinal epithelia and potentiate pro-inflammatory signals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These phenomena have been implicated in disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Enteropathogen-induced pathogenic microbiota biofilm alterations and pathobiont dispersion coincide with mucus disruption (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x000a0;and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Bacteria dispersed from human microbiota biofilms obtained from patients with IBD&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), or from microbiota made dysbiotic by exposure to the intestinal prozoan parasite <italic>Giardia</italic> sp. are able to translocate epithelial barriers, and to induce the production of pro-inflammatory CXCL-8 in human epithelia and in germ-free mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Similar adherence of microbiota biofilm fragments to the epithelial surface has recently been reported in polyposis and colorectal cancer, where secretion of biofilm metabolites such as polyamines have been detected at concentrations 62-times higher than in microbiota biofilms from healthy tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These observations highlight the importance of identifying mucosal microbiota biofilm metabolomic characteristics in disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Beyond abnormalities in their taxonomic representations, a better understanding of how phenotypic and functional disruptions of commensal gut mucosal biofilm communities are regulated will pave the way towards novel therapies. Investigations of biofilms in mono-and multi-species communities will shed new light on our understanding of microbial metabolism, genetic variability, antibiotic resistance, and of mechanisms leading to post-transcriptional modifications.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Key concepts</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><italic>Microbial Biofilms</italic>: Aggregates of microbial communities (best characterized for bacteria) that adhere to a surface and to each other, embedded within an extra-cellular matrix made of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA.

While these effects are best characterized for bacterial pathogens, they also operate against parasitic and viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The mechanisms include selective colonization sites, competitive niche exclusion via metabolic interactions and steric hindrance, production of antimicrobials by commensals (eg. bacteriocin), control of pathogen replication, modulation of the mucus barrier, as well as the induction and/or inhibition of specific host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Conversely, much less is known of how enteropathogens are able to affect commensal microbiota. Based on the observations that enteric infections are often followed by post-infectious bouts of Irritable Bowel syndrome, causing flares in patients with IBD, and leading to a variety extra-intestinal complications, recent studies have investigated whether a common pathway whereby these effects may arise is through pathogen-induced disruptions of the gut microbiota, which in turn may drive pathology even when the instigating micro-organism has been cleared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Populations in industrialized countries, with their characteristic high protein and high fat diets, harbour different microbiota than those living in rural areas of developing countries, where a polysaccharide-rich diet is the norm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In rural areas of low income countries, there is an increased representation of mostly gram-negative Bacteroidetes, which can hydrolyze undigestable xylose fibers, whereas gram-positive Firmicutes are the predominant bacterial phylum in high income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Both phyla account for more than 95% of the bacteria present in the human gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The relative sensitivity of these microbiota constituents to enteropathogens remains poorly understood. Recent research from our laboratory and others have now clearly demonstrated that exposure to acute enteropathogens represents yet another important environmental factor able to shape the gut microbiota. The pathogens found to modify human and animal microbiota include bacteria, parasites (Protozoa and Helminths), and viruses (the potential role of Archea is not discussed in this review) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The mechanisms implicate the release of pathogenic products that may affect both microbiota and host components, modifications of the mucus barrier, redistribution of epithelial Toll-Like Receptors, as well as modulation of host immune responses as least in part by promoting regulatory Tcells that suppress protective responses to inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Enteropathogen-modified microbiota directly affect host immunity, and indeed these dysbiotic microbiota are able to cause or exacerbate gut inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

These microbiota alterations do not occur upon exposure to the commensal bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast, the enteropathogen <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> is able to modify gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and to promote the expression of latent virulent genes in non-invasive <italic>E. coli</italic>, including fimbrial genes (<italic>fimA</italic>, <italic>sfmF)</italic>, flagellar genes (<italic>fliD)</italic>, and genes regulating Hemolysin E (<italic>hlyE</italic>); these effects are associated with disruptions of TLR4 gene expression, and promote the release of pro-inflammatory CXCL-8 in human intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

These observations shed light on how infections with <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, and other enteropathogens, including parasites and viruses, may exacerbate inflammation in patients with IBD, lead to post-infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and perhaps contribute to extra-intestinal complications, such as haemolytic-uremic syndrome, endocarditis, and a variety of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].

Finally, noteworthy to this discussion, enteric murine norovirus can add to the function of commensal bacteria and act as a beneficial commensal, in a type I interferon signaling-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. While the mechanisms require further investigation, these findings indicate that eukaryotic viruses of the microbiota are capable to support intestinal homeostasis, as do bacterial commensals. This effect goes well beyond the known effects of bacteriophages on commensal microbiota. Viral participation in the microbiota biofilm mode of growth remains obscure. Finally, in addition to direct effects on microbiota through secreted products, enteropathogens may also modulate colonization by infectious or commensal bacteria in the gut by inducing the production of anti-microbial peptides from the host epithelium, and/or by modulating the host inflammatory response; in turn, these effects may attenuate or exacerbate disease symptoms during enteric infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].

This review highlights recently discovered pathogenic mechanisms that appear to be shared when induced by enteropathogens, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and colo-rectal cancer. Beyond the classical disruptions of microbial abundance and diversity, these shared processes involve the disturbance of the gut microbiota biofilm phenotyoe and function, and the dispersion of planktonic bacteria from these commensal communities. These dispersed microorganisms may become pathobionts, and have been causally implicated in disease development, at least in part by invading the mucus barrier, adhering the intestinal epithelium, translocating through enterocytes, and activating various pro-inflammatory pathways, including a recently uncovered mechanism that promotes regulatory T cells which suppress protective responses to inflammatory stimuli. In IBD and colo-rectal cancer, the best characterized bacterial commensals escaping from a disturbed microbiota biofilm and turned pathobionts include Adhering Invasive <italic>E. coli</italic> (AIEC)<italic>, Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum.</italic> Iron-acquisition is a critical factor for bacterial pathogenicity, and recent discoveries have linked this process to the expression of virulence factors in gut commensals that have become pathobionts. More research in the metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic (both for the uptake and release of metabolites) profiles of pathobionts dispersed from dysbiotic gut microbiota biofilms will pave the way towards the developments of new therapies that may restore homeostasis. In view of the numerous clinical conditions that result from microbiota dysbiosis, this field of microbiome research carries enormous translational potential.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Some of the research findings discussed in this review were funded by grants from the Natural Scences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery grant and NSERC-CREATE grant), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Crohn&#x02019;s and Colitis Canada, the Alberta Ingenuity Fund, the University of Calgary (Eyes High postdoctoral initiative, and the Colon Cancer Screening unit), and AgreenSkillsPlus (PCOFUND-GA-2013-609398).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par21">Some of the research findings discussed in this review were funded by grants from the Natural Scences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery grant and NSERC-CREATE grant), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Crohn&#x02019;s and Colitis Canada, the Alberta Ingenuity Fund, the University of Calgary (Eyes High postdoctoral initiative, and the Colon Cancer Screening unit), and AgreenSkillsPlus (PCOFUND-GA-2013-609398).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par22">Not applicable.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AGB wrote the article.
