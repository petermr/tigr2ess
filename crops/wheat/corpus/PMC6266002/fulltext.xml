Intake of gluten, a major component of wheat, rye, and barley, affects the microbiota and increases the intestinal permeability. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that gluten peptides, after crossing the intestinal barrier, lead to a more inflammatory milieu. Gluten peptides enter the pancreas where they affect the morphology and might induce beta-cell stress by enhancing glucose- and palmitate-stimulated insulin secretion. Interestingly, animal studies and a human study have demonstrated that a gluten-free (GF) diet during pregnancy reduces the risk of T1D. Evidence regarding the role of a GF diet in T2D is less clear. Some studies have linked intake of a GF diet to reduced obesity and T2D and suggested a role in reducing leptin- and insulin-resistance and increasing beta-cell volume. The current knowledge indicates that gluten, among many environmental factors, may be an aetiopathogenic factors for development of T1D and T2D. However, human intervention trials are needed to confirm this and the proposed mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>beta cell</kwd><kwd>beta-cell stress</kwd><kwd>celiac disease</kwd><kwd>gluten-free diet</kwd><kwd>high-fat diet-induced obesity</kwd><kwd>intestinal permeability</kwd><kwd>islet of Langerhans</kwd><kwd>NOD mouse</kwd><kwd>type 1 diabetes</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-10-01746"><title>1. Gluten</title><p>During the recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of GF products available with the promise of diverse health benefits. The incidence of celiac disease (CD) was estimated to be 33.6 per 10,000 person-years in a recent retrospective cohort study from the United Kingdom [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is thought to be more common, although the precise number is unknown [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consumption of gluten is believed to affect many aspects of human health and is hypothesised to contribute to the diabetes pandemic, in which the number of people suffering from diabetes have quadrupled since 1980 to an estimated 422 million in 2014 [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Gluten entered our diet about 10,000 years ago in Mesopotamia when our ancestors began eating cereals. Today cereals are an essential food source around the world and more than 50% of the worlds daily caloric intake is derived from consumption of cereals [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </p><p>Wheat, rye, and barley contain high amounts of gluten in their endosperm storage tissue. Chemically, gluten is classified as a prolamin, containing monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenins. Glutenins can be subdivided into low and high molecular weight proteins while gliadins are divided into &#x003b1;-, &#x003b3;-, and &#x003c9;-gliadins [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The major amino acid constituents of gluten are proline, glutamine, and hydrophobic amino acids [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which make gluten resistant to complete degradation by gastric, pancreatic, and brush-border enzymes [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. &#x003b1;-gliadin contains some of the most toxic peptides in gluten, as evidenced by in vitro studies, and their effect has been mapped to specific domains in the structure [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The effect of the peptides are diverse and include gut-permeating [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], cytokine-releasing [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and cytotoxic [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] effects. The 33-mer from &#x003b1;-gliadin is the most immunogenic gluten peptide discovered so far, as it contains three overlapping T cell epitopes [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and processing by APCs is not required before T cell presentation [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The 33-mer is resistant to degradation by intestinal peptidases [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and was recently identified in all of the modern and old cultivars of wheat and spelt analysed [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-10-01746"><title>2. Gluten and T1D</title><p>T1D is initiated when autoreactive T cells destroy the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas leading to hypoinsulinaemia, and hyperglycaemia; however, the aetiology and pathogenesis are still not fully understood. T1D is classified as a multifactorial disease in which the genetic background, as well as environmental factors, are important determinants. Approximately 50% of the genetic risk of the disease is explained by the HLA class II region [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the haplotypes HLA-DR3-DQ2 and HLA-DR4-DQ8 are the most important individual genetic risk factors known [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In the period from 1990&#x02013;1999, the average annual increase in the incidence of T1D was 2.8% in children aged &#x02264;14 years [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another epidemiological study predicted that the incidence would double between 2005 and 2020 in European children below five years of age [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. </p><p>A key question is why the incidence of T1D is increasing now when gluten was introduced 10,000 years ago. Among many possible reasons, such as an increased exposure to other diabetogenic environmental factors, a recent study in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of autoimmune diabetes, found that modern wheat sources are more diabetogenic that old wheat sources [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1-nutrients-10-01746"><title>2.1. The Role of Environmental Factors</title><p>Environmental factors are important in the pathogenesis of T1D. First, the incidence of T1D has been rising globally at a pace that cannot be explained by genetic drift [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Second, increasing incidence has been observed in population groups that have migrated from regions with low incidence of T1D to regions with high incidence [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Third, a six-fold gradient in the incidence of T1D is observed between Russian Karelia and Finland, although the frequency of the high-risk HLA-DQ genotypes is equal in the two populations [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and similar gradients between neighbouring countries are also known [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Fourth, monozygotic twins are most often discordant for T1D [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Fifth, T1D develops in less than 10% of subjects with HLA-conferred risk genotypes [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although all risk genotypes are most likely not identified yet. </p><p>Many environmental factors have been associated with increased susceptibility to T1D, including physiological stress, vaccines, toxins, cow milk [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and dietary gluten. Evidence for a viral aetiology has grown during the recent years [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] exemplified by the Diabetes virus detection (DiViD) study that demonstrated low-grade enterovirus infection in islets from the majority of the newly diagnosed T1D patients investigated but not in any of the non-diabetic controls [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this regard, the hygiene hypothesis is central, stating that children who are exposed to microorganisms will develop strong immunity against these, which will dampen the harmful effects from them, but also protect the child from T1D [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Thus, T1D is a multifactorial disease where many environmental factors are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis, including gluten.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-10-01746"><title>2.2. GF Diet, Early Evidence and Timing</title><p>Early studies in NOD mice [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and biobreeding (BB) rats [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which are animal models for autoimmune diabetes, suggested that cereals might have a role in the aetiopathogenesis of T1D. Later, a study in NOD mice demonstrated that a lifelong GF diet compared to a gluten-containing standard (STD) diet reduced the incidence of autoimmune diabetes from 64% to 15%, although insulitis score was not significantly reduced [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and subsequent studies in NOD mice demonstrated similar results [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In a more recent study in NOD mice, we showed that the incidence of autoimmune diabetes could be reduced even further, to 8%, together with reduced insulitis in offspring, by keeping the mothers on a GF diet exclusively during pregnancy [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Similar, but smaller effects on incidence and insulitis in NOD mouse offspring were demonstrated by keeping the mice GF in utero and in early postnatal life [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The GF diets used it these studies had the gluten protein replaced with other proteins (meat, casein, or egg white) while keeping an equal content relative to the STD diets of protein, fat, and components that may influence the risk of diabetes such as milk and soybean [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B43-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although the major difference between the GF and STD diets was gluten, small differences were present between other dietary components. Human evidence for the existence of an early time-window for the introduction of gluten and tolerance induction includes the BABYDIAB and Diabetes and Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) cohort studies. These studies showed that the risk of islet autoimmunity increased if gluten was introduced before the age of three months compared with receiving only breast milk during this period [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or first exposure to gluten between age four and six months [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], after adjustment for covariates. Moreover, it was shown that breastfeeding during the introduction of gluten was associated with decreased risk of islet autoimmunity in children at high risk of T1D [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Recently, we published a study based on the Danish National Birth Cohort, which demonstrated that maternal ingestion of low versus high amounts of gluten during pregnancy reduced the risk (2-fold) of T1D in their children, after adjustment of covariates [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Other cohort studies showed no association between intake of GF diet during pregnancy and T1D, again after adjustment of covariates [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In two Danish studies, a GF diet was administered to children after T1D diagnosis and the children showed improvements in disease parameters including prolonged partial remission periods and reduced HBA1c compared to control children with T1D matched by diabetes duration and age [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Another study investigated how children at increased risk of T1D responded to six months of GF diet followed by six months of gluten-containing diet (diets were not matched for carbohydrate content etc.) [<xref rid="B52-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Following the GF diet, the children showed improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (non-significant) but unchanged titres of islet autoantibodies. Following the months of the gluten-containing diet, the study reported a decreased insulin sensitivity. Hence, a GF diet may have a preserving effect on beta-cell function on older children with T1D.</p><p>In summary, the studies suggest that a GF diet may have the potential to reduce the risk of T1D. Interestingly, a GF diet seems to be most effective when applied in utero, and timing of the introduction of gluten is apparently critical. Moreover, a few studies indicate that a GF diet, when applied to older children with T1D, may preserve the beta cells to some extent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-10-01746"><title>2.3. GF Diet and the Intestine</title><p>The intestinal microbiota seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of T1D but causality is still unclear. Patients with T1D have an increased intestinal permeability [<xref rid="B53-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and show a decrease in bacteria that maintain the intestinal permeability [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Perturbation of the intestinal microbiota in childhood is thought to disturb the developing immune system and may thus be a pathogenic factor [<xref rid="B59-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. NOD mice fed a GF versus a STD diet had overall fewer bacteria as well as fewer aerobic and microaerobic bacteria in caecum [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In a similar study, NOD mice on a GF diet showed decreased <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Tanerella</italic> and <italic>Barnesiella</italic> species and increased <italic>Akkermansia</italic> species in faeces [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A GF diet during pregnancy and early postnatal life has been demonstrated to induce pronounced differences in the intestinal microbiota of NOD mouse mothers and offspring, including increased numbers of bacteria from the phylae <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, and <italic>TM7</italic> [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The mucin-degrading <italic>Akkermansia</italic> is of special interest in T1D. For example, NOD mice treated with vancomycin from an early age had increased proportions of <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and reduced incidence of autoimmune diabetes [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition to the association to T1D, <italic>Akkermansia</italic> species reversed the increased intestinal permeability in Apolipoprotein E (Apoe)&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice and decreased the entry of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the circulation [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Interestingly, a study in children from the BABYDIET study showed that <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-dominated children were more likely to develop islet autoantibodies and had decreased potential to butyrate production compared to <italic>Akkermansia</italic>-dominated children [<xref rid="B63-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by bacteria during breakdown of dietary fibre and include butyrate, acetate, and propionate. Butyrate and acetate diminish the intestinal permeability [<xref rid="B64-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and butyrate can boost the number and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [<xref rid="B65-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], which are known to suppress inflammatory responses.

GF Ddiet and the Immune System</title><p>We and others have conducted a range of animal studies, which suggest that a GF diet modulates the innate and adaptive immune system (<xref rid="nutrients-10-01746-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>A GF diet reduced the natural killer (NK) cell activity in pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) from Bagg albino (BALB/c) mice and in spleen from NOD mice compared to mice on a STD diet [<xref rid="B68-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Another study in NOD mice confirmed this observation in spleen and found reduced activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in PLN [<xref rid="B69-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Besides NK cells, macrophages from mice have been shown to produce proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)6, IL12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA), among others) upon gliadin stimulation [<xref rid="B74-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Dendritic cells (DCs) may also be affected by a GF diet, as the diet reduced the proportions in thePLN and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and increased the proportions of tolerogenic DCs in PLN in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="B69-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This study also found downregulation of DC activation markers in lymphoid organs from the GF mice. This is supported by a study showing that gliadin stimulation of bone marrow-derived DCs from BALB/c mice resulted in maturation of the cells, as seen by evaluation of activation markers and chemokines (keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)) [<xref rid="B75-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Moreover, gliadin stimulation may increase the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)4, 7, 8 and interferon alpha (IFNA) in DCs of DQ8 transgenic mice [<xref rid="B76-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. As for the adaptive immune system, we have shown that a GF diet reduced the proportion of T helper (TH)17 cells in PLN of BALB/c mice [<xref rid="B72-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and dampened the inflammatory profile of T cells [<xref rid="B73-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. A wheat-free versus a wheat-based diet has been shown to reduce the proportion of TH1 cells in MLN from young diabetes-prone BB rats [<xref rid="B71-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Three studies in NOD mice found that a GF diet during pregnancy alleviated T1D in the offspring and that the mechanisms were likely to involve changes in the immune system. The first study showed that the intestines from the offspring exposed to the GF diet in utero had an increased gene expression of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This study also showed that the GF diet increased the proportion of Tregs in PLN and decreased the proportion of DCs in PLN, MLN, and spleen in the offspring. Moreover, the traffic of T cells between PLN and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) was increased. Recently, we demonstrated that a GF diet during pregnancy reduced the expression of interferon gamma (IFNG) in TH cells and IL22 in gamma delta T receptor (gdTCR)<sup>+</sup> T cells from spleen of NOD mouse offspring [<xref rid="B67-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This is of interest because IFNG [<xref rid="B77-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and IL22 [<xref rid="B78-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] might have a role in T1D. Furthermore, we demonstrated a reduced inflammatory profile in subpopulations of T cells from lymphoid organs of offspring exposed to a GF diet in utero [<xref rid="B67-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In another study, we observed that the gene expression of TH17 cells was reduced in colon from NOD mice exposed to a GF diet in utero [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These results were confirmed in NOD mice fed an anti-diabetogenic diet compared to a wheat-based diet from a young age [<xref rid="B70-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The mice showed reduced numbers of TH17 cells, besides reduced numbers of activated TH cells and DCs and reduced incidence of autoimmune diabetes. Taken together, a GF diet has a dampening effect on the innate and adaptive immune system, as evidenced in different animal models (<xref rid="nutrients-10-01746-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Human evidence of the effect of gluten on the immune system is more limited. Early evidence includes a study from 1987 demonstrating increased titres of anti-gliadin antibodies at the onset of T1D in 54% of patients with no signs of CD and in none of the healthy controls [<xref rid="B79-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].

In another study, 47% of the included patients with T1D and no CD and none of the healthy controls displayed increased proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after stimulation with wheat polypeptides, and the cytokine response was a proinflammatory TH1/TH17 [<xref rid="B81-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. On the other hand, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells from children with pre-T1D and multiple islet autoantibodies compared to healthy controls showed decreased proliferative responses after gliadin stimulation [<xref rid="B82-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. DCs may be affected by gluten as well. This is shown in a study where gliadin stimulation of monocyte-derived DCs from healthy donors resulted in increased expression of maturation markers (CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR molecules), increased production of chemokines and cytokines (TNFA, IL6, IL8, IL10 among others), increased capacity to stimulate proliferation of allogeneic T cells, as well as reduced endocytic activity [<xref rid="B83-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the studies suggest that a GF diet reduces inflammation in the intestines and pancreas, involving many cell types of the immune system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01746-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-nutrients-10-01746"><title>2.5. GF Diet, Risk of T1D and CD</title><p>CD is a chronic autoimmune disease that results in inflammation of the intestinal submucosa and destruction of the intestinal epithelium. The following clinical signs are typically observed: increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, villus atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. The treatment consists of a strict GF diet and if not initiated it will lead to undernourishment. The pathogenesis is thought to start with binding of gliadin to the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on enterocytes, which results in increased intestinal permeability by myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent zonulin release and crossing of the lamina propria by gliadin [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At this site, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) deamidates glutamine residues in gliadin to glutamate, which mediates high affinity of gliadin to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 on APCs and thus activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for gliadin [<xref rid="B84-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].

The majority of NOD mice [<xref rid="B93-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and 12% of patients with T1D are seropositive for anti-tTG [<xref rid="B94-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In addition, NOD mice on a STD versus a GF diet have reduced villus height and increased infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes (enteropathy) [<xref rid="B95-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], and human subjects exhibit signs of enteropathy already from the pre-diabetic stage [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Jejunal biopsies from children with T1D versus healthy controls were stimulated with gliadin [<xref rid="B96-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The result was increased proportions in lamina propria of intraepithelial T cells and increased expression of CD25<sup>+</sup> (IL2RA), CD80<sup>+</sup> (co-stimulatory), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and crypt HLA-DR. Thus, NOD mice and patients with T1D exhibit signs of CD, which underlines that the two diseases are associated and indicates that gluten may be a common environmental factor. This is supported by a study in NOD mice, which showed that a GF versus a STD diet decreased intraepithelial infiltration of T cells, expression of IFNG, enteropathy and incidence of autoimmune diabetes [<xref rid="B95-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].

More recently, administration of gliadin intranasally to four-week-old NOD mice was shown to decrease the incidence of autoimmune diabetes and insulitis and increase the numbers of gdTCR<sup>+</sup> cells and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs in mucosal lymphoid organs [<xref rid="B100-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].

Gluten peptides are likely in close contact with the beta cells because of the high degree of vascularisation in islets [<xref rid="B107-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In vitro studies on INS-1E insulinoma cells and isolated rat islets showed that gliadin increased glucose-stimulated insulin-secretion (GSIS) by closing ATP-dependent K-channels [<xref rid="B108-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].

A gluten-containing STD versus a GF diet is known to increase insulitis in animal models of T1D [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B43-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B67-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and inflammatory cell-stress increases the expression and enzyme activity of tTG [<xref rid="B110-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. tTG has been shown to induce posttranslational modifications of human islet antigens and thereby increase the affinity to HLA-DQ [<xref rid="B111-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>].

Obesity, a result of imbalance between energy intake and expenditure because of excess intake of food and insufficient physical activity [<xref rid="B120-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], most likely plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of T2D [<xref rid="B121-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>].

The national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) study, which consists of a number of cross-sectional surveys carried out every second year, demonstrated higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL), smaller waist circumference and self-reported weight loss in persons on a GF diet [<xref rid="B153-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Further human evidence includes a study in children with autism spectrum disorder on a GF casein-free diet versus a regular diet for three months, showing lower body weight and body mass index [<xref rid="B154-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. A recent prospective cohort study from the USA based on the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found an inverse association between intake of gluten and risk of T2D [<xref rid="B155-nutrients-10-01746" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. The analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates such as fibre and folic acid, which are often low in a GF diet, and the association was slightly weakened after adjustment of cereal fibre. Excluding gluten from the diet will mediate exclusion of other potential anti-diabetogenic factors; hence, this study is not conclusive and should be followed up with an intervention study. In summary, a few intervention studies have shown that a GF diet may alleviate obesity and T2D in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01746-f002">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, a recent prospective cohort study report that a GF diet is associated with T2D. Thus, larger intervention studies clarifying the effect of a GF diet on T2D patients are needed. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-nutrients-10-01746"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this review, we looked at the role of dietary gluten as a contributing factor in the aetiopathogenesis of T1D and T2D. Gluten has multiple effects in the body starting in the intestine where it affects the composition of the microbiota, may induce enteropathy in T1D, and increases the intestinal permeability, all of which seem to improve with a GF diet. In animals, gluten has been found to cross the intestinal barrier together with LPS among other substances and may accumulate in different tissues including islets and adipose tissue. In animal beta cells, gluten peptides induce insulin secretion, an effect that is potentiated by palmitate, suggesting that gluten peptides may induce beta cell-stress, -dysfunction, -loss, and autoimmunity, and thus contribute to both T1D and T2D. Moreover, gluten peptides may also contribute to leptin- and insulin resistance, regarding obesity and T2D. Primarily animal studies have shown that a GF diet dampens the innate and adaptive immune system leading to a less inflammatory profile. In T1D, the timing of gluten introduction to children is most likely critical, and the efficiency of gluten exclusion during pregnancy, combined with early introduction of gluten postnatally, should be investigated as a prevention strategy in an intervention study. Interestingly, animal studies suggest that a GF diet in utero may also reduce the risk of CD and report changes in the pancreas morphology including increased numbers of islets. Postnatally, a GF diet remains an interesting therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of T1D, but more human intervention studies must be carried out. Mucosal tolerance induction of gluten is another potential strategy in reducing the risk of T1D but this also needs further exploration.</p><p>In T2D, the evidence for an alleviating effect of a GF diet is more uncertain especially regarding the few human studies that have been conducted, although animal studies report improvements of both obesity and T2D. A GF diet is typically low in fibres and other antidiabetogenic nutrients, and studies investigating the long-term effects on obesity and T2D of gluten specifically are therefore needed.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualisation, M.H.-J.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, M.H.-J.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, M.H.-J.,

In the blood, a GF diet decreases the level of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines and increases the anti-inflammatory adiponectin. A GF diet reduces obesity and improves the regulation of lipid metabolism by upregulating peroxisome proliferator activator receptor alpha (PPARA) and peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARG) in adipose tissue. This, in turn, leads to increased insulin sensitivity and improved glucose tolerance, which is further improved by reduced beta-cell stress and increased beta-cell volume.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nutrients-10-01746-g002"/></fig><table-wrap id="nutrients-10-01746-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">nutrients-10-01746-t001_Table 1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>An overview of some of the effects that a gluten-free (GF) diet has on the immune system in animal models of type 1 diabetes (T1D).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
