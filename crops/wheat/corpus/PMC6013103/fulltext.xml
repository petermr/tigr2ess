Dwarfing genes (<italic>Rht</italic>) are known for yield gains due to lodging resistance and partitioning of assimilates into ear. The available and commercially exploited sources of dwarfism in Indian spring wheat are <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht</italic>2 genes inspite of availability of over 20 dwarfing genes. <italic>Rht8</italic> a Gibberellic acid sensitive dwarfing gene is another reduced height gene commercially exploited in some Mediterranean countries. Two F<sub>2</sub> populations segregating for <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht8</italic> genes with each comprising 398 and 379 plants were developed by crossing European winter wheat cultivars Beauchamp and Capitole with Indian spring wheat cultivar PBW 621. Different genotypic combinations for <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht8</italic> genes were selected from these populations through linked molecular markers and selected F<sub>3:4</sub> lines were evaluated for various agronomic traits in a replicated trial. Reduction in plant height with <italic>Rht8</italic> and <italic>Rht1</italic> averaged 2.86% and 13.3% respectively as compared to the group of lines lacking dwarfing gene. Reduction was spread along all the internodes of wheat culm and reduction was lower as progress towards the lower internode. Grain number per spike and highest yield was observed in lines carrying only <italic>Rht1</italic> gene. Reduction in plant biomass was observed with either of the dwarfing gene. Longest coleoptile length and seedling shoot length averaged 4.4 &#x000b1; 0.09 cm and 19.5 &#x000b1; 0.48, respectively was observed in lines lacking any of the dwarfing gene. Negligible reduction of 6.75% and 2.84% in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length, respectively was observed in lines carrying only <italic>Rht8</italic> gene whereas F<sub>3:4</sub> lines with <italic>Rht1</italic> gene showed 21.64% and 23.35% reduction in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length, respectively. Additive effect of genes was observed as double dwarfs showed 43.31% and 43.34% reduction in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>To meet the escalating demand of fast growing human population, there is need of continuous increase in wheat grain production. Optimizing plant stature to enhance productivity under ever changing and unpredictable climate is one of the major strategy of plant breeders. Reduced height in wheat is often associated with increase in yield, probably, owing to reduced lodging and enhanced partitioning of assimilates to the grain [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The control of plant height in wheat is known to be complex because of its polygenic nature and environmental effects. Genes with this ability have been difficult to detect, resulting in the vast majority of the world&#x02019;s semi-dwarf wheat crop cultivars having their height reduction determined primarily by one of two major genes derived from the old Japanese cultivar &#x02018;Norin 10&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Worldwide, during the past century, the average height of bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> 2n = 6x = 42) has been dramatically reduced. For example, the average heights of wheat varieties have dropped from 150 cm to 90 cm in UK [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and from 107 cm to the current height of around 90 cm in China [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In India, the Indo-Gangetic fertile crescent is the main wheat producing region and is classified as North Western Plain Zone (NWPZ) of India. Plant height in NWPZ has been steadily reduced from over 130 cm (tall traditional cultivars of pre-dwarfing era) to 84 cm (present day cultivars). The saga of green revolution in India is very well known and semi-dwarf varieties played a role of fuel for green revolution. <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht2</italic> dwarfing genes were transferred from Japan to USA, USA to CIMMYT, Mexico and from Mexico to all over the wheat cultivated area through Japanese variety Norin-10. <italic>Rht8</italic> is mainly commercialized in Europe and transferred through Japanese variety Akakomugi from Japan to Italy and then from Italy to other parts of Europe [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These reduced height genes are effective in reducing plant height and have been widely adopted in wheat breeding programs since their introduction in the 1950s [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Their use has been associated with increased wheat yields particularly where conditions for growth are favorable [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>Rht1-B1b</italic> and <italic>Rht1-D1b</italic> dwarfing alleles of <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht2</italic> not only reduce the plant stature, but also reduce the coleoptile length which is the deciding factor for early emergence under water deficit or stress conditions and hence, effect the crop stand. It has also been well documented that dwarfing genes <italic>Rht-B1b</italic> and <italic>Rht-D1b</italic> are associated with Type I susceptibility to Fusarium head blight in wheat and low anther extrusion [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous studies on <italic>Rht</italic> genes have concluded that <italic>Rht8</italic> gene reduces the plant height but it has negligible effect on coleoptile length [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199330.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The study on effect of combination of GA responsive <italic>Rht8</italic> gene and GA insensitive <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht2</italic> genes have been conducted in Australian cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in some winter wheat cultivars. But the potential of combining these genes in Indian spring wheat background have not been previously assessed. Considering this, the aim of the study was to assess the potential of <italic>Rht8</italic> gene in combination with <italic>Rht1</italic> gene in elite spring wheat background under Indian environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Population development</title><p>Two crosses (Beauchamp x PBW 621 and Capitole x PBW 621) were generated between cultivars Beauchamp and Capitole (having gene <italic>Rht8c)</italic> and genotype PBW 621 (having gene <italic>Rht1)</italic> in main season 2012&#x02013;13. Beauchamp and Capitole are winter wheat varieties released in France in 1978 and 1964, respectively. These lines were selected from a diverse European winter wheat germplasm set of 376 cultivars that had been procured by Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab, India from National Institute of Agricultural Botany, Cambridge, UK in 2010. PBW 621 is a spring wheat cultivar released in Indian in 2011 and widely grown in NWPZ of India. The F<sub>1</sub> plants of these crosses were self-pollinated to generate F<sub>2</sub> population. In wheat growing season 2014&#x02013;15, 398 F<sub>2</sub> plants from cross Beauchamp x PBW 621 and 379 F<sub>2</sub> plants from Capitole x PBW 621 were space planted and plant height data was recorded. Further without any selection all of the F<sub>2</sub> plants were allowed to self-pollinate to generate F<sub>3</sub> progenies. The presence and absence of dwarfing allele(s) of both the <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht8</italic> loci were determined by using linked molecular markers [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Therefore, based on the plant height data and molecular data 16 and 17 F<sub>3</sub> progenies of Beauchamp x PBW 621 and Capitole x PBW 621 cross, respectively were identified as being double dwarfs (<italic>Rht1</italic> + <italic>Rht8</italic>) or single dwarf (either <italic>Rht1</italic> or <italic>Rht8</italic>) or tall (no dwarfing allele). Two plants from each of these progenies were harvested separately and multiplied at Keylong, Himachal Pradesh (off-season research station of Punjab Agricultural University) and 45 of these F<sub>3:4</sub> lines with similar growth period were selected for agronomic evaluation in main season 2016&#x02013;17 at experimental area, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Genotyping for <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht8</italic></title><p>Young leaves of parental lines and F<sub>3</sub> progenies which seemed phenotypically homozygous were collected and genomic DNA was extracted using the standard CTAB (Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) procedure [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The SSR marker WMS 261 for <italic>Rht8</italic> and gene specific dominant markers BF, WR1 and MR1 for <italic>Rht1</italic> were used.

Genotyping with WMS 261 marker showed a 192 bp band in Beauchamp and Capitole and approximately 165 bp band in PBW 621. Considering Norin-10, the source of dwarfism in Indian cultivar which carries both <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht2</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], parents were screened for both <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht2</italic>. Genotypes C-306 and C-518, the tall traditional varieties, widely grown before green revolution were used as a control. None of the parental genotype showed the presence of dwarfing allele of <italic>Rht2</italic> gene with DF-WR2 primer combination. With BF-MR1 primer combination for <italic>Rht-B1a</italic> allele (tall allele), all of the lines showed amplification but C-varieties and European winter wheat lines showed very high intensity PCR product whereas PBW 621 gave very faint band.

However, they have showed that presence of both <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht8</italic> gene together shortened CL by 28.4% whereas in the present investigation 42.94% reduction in CL has been observed. Less effect of <italic>Rht8</italic> on coleoptile length and on early growth stages of wheat has been reported in many studies [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199330.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The observation of highest yield of <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>R</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>r</italic><sub><italic>8</italic></sub><italic>r</italic><sub><italic>8</italic></sub> category is consistent with the &#x02018;tall dwarf&#x02019; model proposed [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They have proposed that grain yield can be maximized by combining gibberellin-insensitive <italic>Rht</italic> alleles with other genes which increase both plant height and yield. Report of yield advantage with gibberellin insensitive <italic>Rht</italic> dwarfing genes over tall controls are also available [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Yield increase by <italic>Rht1</italic> or <italic>Rht2</italic> and decrease by <italic>Rht8</italic> have also been reported [<xref rid="pone.0199330.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, they showed 6.1% and 14.1% yield increase by <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht2</italic>, respectively and 21.0% and 5.3% yield reduction by <italic>Rht8</italic> in two different genetic background.</p><p>The present study revealed pleiotropic effect of dwarfing genes along with effect on plant height. Under favorable conditions, lines with <italic>Rht1</italic> gene out yielded as compared to the lines having <italic>Rht8</italic> gene. However, for seedling traits lines with <italic>Rht8</italic> were better performing than lines with <italic>Rht1</italic> gene. Coleoptile length is one of the important trait for deep sowing under drought condition to capture moisture from deeper soil. For conservation agriculture, emergence under deep sowing is needed and cultivars with longer coleoptile can emerge quickly and can have better plant vigor. Hence, understanding of such pleiotropic interactions of dwarfing genes with different genetic background will facilitate effective deployment of dwarfing genes in modern varieties. The results of present study showed that lines which carry both <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht8</italic> gene together has showed very high reduction in CL and SL. Such cultivars will not be suitable under water limiting conditions. Hence, considering the coleoptile length as an indicator for better emergence under drought conditions, it is suggested that in order to breed spring wheat cultivars for drought tolerance or water use efficiency, there is need to replace the residents dwarfing genes of Indian spring wheat cultivars which mainly consists of either <italic>Rht1</italic> or <italic>Rht2</italic>. Wheat breeders in the NWPZ of India must adopt <italic>Rht8</italic> as an environmentally adaptable alternative semi-dwarfing gene. The <italic>Rht8</italic> gene can also be successfully combined with some <italic>Ppd</italic> and <italic>Vrn</italic> genes to offer height reduction and adaptability in the niche micro environments of region so as the duration of the crop can be extended to translate into yield enhancement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Segregating population of <italic>Rht1</italic> and <italic>Rht8</italic> developed by European winter wheats and spring wheat cultivars allowed us to gain the understanding of potential of alternate dwarfing gene in Indian subcontinent. Lines with higher coleoptile length and seedling shoot length which is a deciding factor for crop establishment were identified in the study. This gave the candidate plant material to evaluate and select the material for conservation agriculture which is one of the new emerging breeding objective in light of climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199330.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Mean of various agronomic traits of individual lines of different dwarfing gene combinations.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199330.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0199330.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>LT</given-names></name>. <article-title>Crop Evolution, Adaptation and Yield</article-title>. <source>New Phytol</source>. <year>1997</year>;<volume>38</volume>: <fpage>567</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>574</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800010048x">10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800010048x</ext-link></comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199330.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Worland</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sayers</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Rht1(B. dw), an alternative allelic variant for breeding semi&#x02010;dwarf wheat varieties</article-title>. <source>Plant Breed</source>. <year>1995</year>;<volume>114</volume>: <fpage>397</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>400</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.1995.tb00819.x">10.1111/j.1439-0523.1995.tb00819.x</ext-link></comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199330.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Worland</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sayers</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Korzun</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>. <article-title>Allelic variation at the dwarfing gene Rht8 locus and its significance in international breeding programmes</article-title>. <source>Euphytica</source>. <year>2001</year>;<volume>119</volume>: <fpage>155</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>159</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199330.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>XB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>XH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>YT</given-names></name>. <article-title>Application of dwarf resources and study advance of dwarfing genes in bread wheat</article-title>. <source>Neuc-agronomy journal</source>. <year>2001</year>;<volume>15</volume>: <fpage>188</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>192</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199330.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Borojevic</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Borojevic</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>. <article-title>The transfer and history of &#x0201c;reduced height genes&#x0201d; (Rht) in wheat from Japan to Europe</article-title>. <source>J Hered</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>96</volume>: <fpage>455</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>459</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esi060">10.1093/jhered/esi060</ext-link></comment>
