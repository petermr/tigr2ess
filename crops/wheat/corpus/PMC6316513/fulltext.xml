Introduction</title><p>Globally, wheat is the cereal most used for bread. Although only 35% of all wheat production is consumed by humans, it dominates the international grain trade as 110 of the 250 million tons of traded grain is wheat (<uri xlink:href="http://faostat3.fao.org/">http://faostat3.fao.org/</uri>). There is an increasing demand for wheat in new markets, especially in countries where wheat is not grown. Wheat grain comprises three major groups of components: Starch, proteins, and cell wall polysaccharides, accounting for about 90% of the dry weight [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although proteins are a minority component compared to starch, they are important for the technological properties of wheat. About 80% of the total grain proteins are formed by gluten proteins, which are responsible for the processing properties of wheat flour that enable the manufacture of bread, pasta, noodles, and a wide range of other baked products and ingredients. However, gluten is not a single protein but a mixture, also denoted as prolamins because of the high content of the amino acids proline and glutamine. Classically, gluten proteins are divided into two major fractions, which are different not only in terms of structure and functionality, but also in immunogenicity: (i) The gliadins, which are monomeric, subdivided into &#x003c9;-, &#x003b3;-, and &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-gliadin fractions, and (ii) The glutenins, which form large polymers, comprising of high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) subunits. The gliadins contribute extensibility, whilst the glutenins contribute elasticity to the wheat dough. Considering genetic and proteomic data, a typical bread wheat cultivar may contain about 60 different gluten proteins in the grain, of which 30 are gliadins [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Gluten is also present in other species of the <italic>Triticeae</italic> tribe, which include barley and rye.</p><p>Several pathologies or digestive disorders are related to gluten consumption: Coeliac disease (CD), Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), Wheat allergy, and Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). CD is a systemic immune-mediated disorder elicited by gluten from wheat, barley, and rye in genetically susceptible individuals. Prevalence of CD varies worldwide but it ranges from 0.3 to 2.4% in western countries [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], where some studies have shown that the incidence of this pathology may have increased over time [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. NCGS is a new digestive disorder with symptoms similar to CD, though its incidence is higher than CD [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In NCGS, the autoantibodies that are typical of CD are usually absent; however, an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes may be found in NCGS, since it is a cause of microscopic enteritis [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gluten from wheat seems to be the primary trigger of NCGS, but other components of the diet, such as metabolic proteins called &#x003b1;-amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATI) [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), have been identified as important factors for the development of symptoms [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These findings could indicate that NCGS might not be a separate entity from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or they could be distinct entities with some overlapping features [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>For both CD and NCGS patients, symptoms improve or disappear entirely, when gluten is withdrawn from the diet. Therefore, a gluten free diet (GFD) is at present the most effective treatment available for both patients. However, the nutritional profile of GFDs is of concern, as GFDs are characterized by an unbalanced intake of nutrients, with an excess of saturated and hydrogenated fatty acids; low quantities of alimentary fiber, micronutrients, and vitamins; low contribution to the recommended daily protein intake; and a high carbohydrate content, yielding an increase in the glycemic index [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At the same time, a GFD can be detrimental to gut health as it leads to a reduction in the populations of bacteria that are generally regarded as healthy (<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>B. longum</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>), while populations of potentially unhealthy bacteria increase, parallel to reductions in the intake of polysaccharides after following the GFD [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The down-regulation of immunodominant gluten peptides by RNA interference (RNAi) in wheat is an excellent approach for reducing gluten toxicity. Protein extracts from flour made from wheat lines where all gliadin fractions have been down-regulated show a reduction in the extracts capacity to stimulate the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)DQ2- and DQ8- restricted T-cell clones in CD patients [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among all the low-gliadin lines generated by RNAi, the E82 line was outstanding as it contained very few CD immunogenic epitopes [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and bread made using this line showed notable favorable sensory properties and improved nutritional properties [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the whole-wheat flour of the E82 line administered to rats at three increasing doses for 90 days did not induce any adverse effects, and there was no difference between rats that were fed with the wild type wheat [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Our body is colonized by trillions of microorganisms in a symbiotic state, and these populations have fundamental roles in health and disease. Microbial communities in the gut are involved in the well-being of the innate and adaptive immune system. This nexus between nutrient metabolism and the immune system occurs at different levels, from the sensing of nutrients to endocrine signaling. The host microbiome has been associated with vitamin production, lipid metabolism regulation, the regulation of gene expression, and energy extraction from food [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Intestinal microbiota changes may be involved in the development of several diseases; thus, the importance of keeping a balanced gut microbiota [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Other works have suggested that dietary interventions may be useful to restore potentially beneficial gut microbiota groups within the gut [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We also know that it is possible to intervene in microbiota in a rapid specific manner with diet changes [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Most studies report an imbalance in the gut flora, called dysbiosis, in CD patients treated or untreated with a GFD, and it is likely that this contributes to some persistent gastrointestinal symptoms [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Dysbiosis in NCGS causes gut inflammation, diarrhea, constipation, visceral hypersensitivity, abdominal pain, a dysfunctional metabolic state, and issues with peripheral immune and neuro-immune communication [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the context of this study, the link between the intestine and the brain, the known Gut-Brain axis takes on a key role, since several studies postulate that an increase in intestinal permeability could allow gluten peptides to cross the intestinal barrier, enter to the bloodstream and ultimately cross the blood brain barrier causing neuroinflammation among other symptoms [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In line with this, it has been reported that changes induced by food and more specifically changes in the intestinal microbiota may promote various pathophysiological mechanisms, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction, through the Microbiome-Brain-Gut axis [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hence, dysbiosis, gut inflammation, and chronic dyshomeostasis are of great clinical relevance and we should consider them in the diagnosis and treatment of both NCGS and CD.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acceptability, digestibility, and safety of a bread made using flour from the E82 line with all gliadins strongly downregulated, in volunteer NCGS patients, in comparison with a GFD. In addition, gut microbiota shifts after the consumption of both GF and E82 breads were also investigated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-10-01964"><title>2.

The age range was 31&#x02013;57 years, and 9/11 were female. All subjects showed negative serology for celiac disease (tissue-transglutaminase IgA antibodies) and the duodenal biopsy results presented normal duodenal villi architecture. HLA-DQ2+ was present in five of the subjects, whilst the remaining eight showed a different HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 haplotype.

The RNAi silencing was very effective, and all three gliadin groups were strongly down regulated in this line, particularly the gamma and alpha-gliadins. As reported previously in Reference [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the low molecular weight (LMW) glutenins were also affected by the down regulation in this line, while the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01964-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Overall, a reduction of about 60% in the total prolamins was recorded, which was apparently compensated by a significant increase in the non-gluten proteins, leading to a total protein content similar to the wild type. Determination of gluten content by the R5 antibody-based ELISA showed a reduction of nearly 97% for the E82 line in comparison to that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01964-f001">Figure 1</xref>a).</p><p>Bread derived from the low-gliadin line E82 was made using a simple formulation with no additives and long fermentation times.

The analysis of gluten content (ppm) in the flour and bread by competitive ELISA using the R5 monoclonal antibody showed a significant reduction in the levels of gluten after the fermentation and baking of flour to bread. The content of gluten in flour was 3545 ppm (mean value), while in bread it was 1130 ppm (mean value), which was more than three times less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01964-f001">Figure 1</xref>c).

Discussion</title><p>Our study shows that the consumption of low-gliadin E82 bread for one week had great acceptability by the NCGS patients, since clinical symptoms were the same as those seen with the gluten-free bread, and no differences in the sensory parameters were reported. In addition, we observed potentially positive changes in the composition of the subjects&#x02019; gut microbiota after the E82 bread was consumed. The principal findings were an increase in the relative abundance of the <italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> genera, and a decrease in the <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Blautia</italic>, <italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Coprococcus</italic>, and <italic>Collinsella</italic> genera after the E82 phase, which matched a microbial profile that was previously shown to have a key role in the improvement of gut permeability and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>NCGS is an intestinal disorder, with increasing prevalence especially in western populations, which has led to the increased demand for food products without or with low levels of gluten [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The E82 bread is distinguished by having a very low gliadin content and reduced LMW glutenins, but it has a high non-gluten protein content, which leads to a protein content that is comparable to that of the wild type. Moreover, the low gliadin bread has increased lysine content, with increments that ranged between 24&#x02013;67% compared to the wild type [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This bread has shown a significant decrease in gluten levels after the fermentation and baking of the flour to bread. Long fermentation processes and baking could be implicated in this significant reduction of the gluten from flour to bread. From the analysis of gluten proteins in the E82 and wild type, the most important aspect observed was the reduction in the levels of &#x003b3;-gliadins and &#x003b1;-gliadins, as well as in the ratio of gliadins to glutenins. These results explained the previous findings that protein extracts from the E82 flour were unable to elicit responses in T-cell lines reactive with omega gliadins and caused highly reduced responses with T-cell lines reactive to alpha and gamma epitopes [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the E82 bread may be of interest to those who want to reduce gluten intake and it is a possible alternative to GF-bread for use in GFD diets. The GFD is the only effective treatment for celiac disease and it is also beneficial for NCGS. Nevertheless, a GFD is very complicated to follow, socially inconvenient, and expensive. Both the high processing of gluten free foods and the number of additives used to mimic the functionality of gluten are related with the problem of poor acceptability in the population [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>In this study, responses to the Sensory Questionnaire showed that the overall acceptance was the same when comparing the E82 bread to the gluten free bread of choice consumed by the NCGS volunteers. None of the sensory parameters evaluated showed significant differences when the two types of breads were compared, but aspects such as texture, aroma, and flavor showed a slight tendency to increase with the consumption of the E82 bread. Moreover, the GSRS Questionnaire that assesses the severity of five GI-symptoms (indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and reflux) showed that the NCGS patients&#x02019; scores were similar between both phases. Only patient #1 gave a higher score to the E82 bread (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-10-01964">Figure S1</xref>). Three and five patients showed levels of GIPs that were higher than the limit of quantification after consumption of the GF and E82 breads, respectively. In the case of the GF bread, this could indicate the ingestion (voluntary or not) of food containing gluten during that phase. However, transgressions during the E82 phase cannot rule out either. Additionally, the levels of GIP excreted during the E82 diet ranged between 0 and 0.61 &#x003bc;g/g, whilst the range of GIP excretion values in the normal diet were 0.30 and 75.68 &#x003bc;g/g sample [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], showing a significant decrease in GIP excretion with the E82 diet. Taken together, these results showed a great acceptability of the E82 bread by NCGS patients, which further supported the idea that the E82 bread could be a positive choice as part of a GFD for these patients.</p><p>Previous in vitro studies [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], described how the Gluten Friendly Bread (GFB) produced a beneficial modulation of the gut microbiota in both healthy and CD subjects, increasing the bacterial populations of the genera <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, as well as an increase in the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The first study was based on a batch-culture fermentation system, which simulated the distal region of the human large intestine, whilst the second study used a continuous colonic model in three stages imitating the proximal, transverse, and distal human colon. Although both studies opened a new horizon to explore using gut simulating systems, they presented some limitations such as the number of samples and that these were in vitro studies, making it essential to validate the results in human intervention studies in vivo.</p><p>Our present study evaluated in vivo the effect of bread E82, which could be considered a GFB, on the composition of the intestinal microbiota in eleven patients with NCGS. Our results based on the intestinal microbiota composition showed that the E82 bread consumption induced an increase in the relative abundance of the genus <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, specifically of the species <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic>, and a decrease in the relative abundance of other genera, such as <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Blautia</italic>, <italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Coprococcus</italic>, and <italic>Collinsella</italic> (specifically the species <italic>C. aerofaciens</italic>).

Although there are several studies with controversial results regarding intestinal permeability and NCGS and EC [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], our results could open a future new line of research that studies the contribution of the composition of the intestinal microbiota to the intestinal permeability in these patients.</p><p>Another interesting finding in this study was the increase of the most efficient butyrate-producing bacteria, such as the <italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> genera (<italic>F. prausnitzii</italic>) [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid produced by intestinal microbial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates in the colon and it modifies the expression of the tight junction proteins in favor of gut barrier preservation and reduced gut permeability [<xref rid="B59-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These butyrate-producing genera could play an important role in the maintenance of gut health, considering that they are also known for having an anti-inflammatory capacity [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Our results suggest that the E82 bread consumption favored a less inflammatory phenotype that could be related to the increase of <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, an anti-inflammatory genus, and the decrease of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> a proinflammatory genus, thereby improving the gut inflammation characteristics of NCGS patients [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B63-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The change in the relative abundance of these two genera and the association of the genera with the subjects&#x02019; inflammatory status was in agreement with the results obtained in this study, related to the quantification of GIPs in stool samples after the E82 phase. It is known that both gluten and GIPs stimulate innate immune responses, which favors the inflammation of the intestinal mucosa in NCGS and CD patients [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The measurement of GIPs in stool samples from the volunteers did not show any difference between the basal and E82 phases. These results suggested that the E82 bread could have a similar immunogenic profile as gluten free bread and would promote a healthy inflammation status by its positive effect on gut microbiota composition.</p><p>Our study may have the limitation that the intestinal fungal microbiome, also known as the mycobiome, has not been addressed, as well as the relationship between the bacterial and fungal species of the gut microbiota in these patients. Currently, the study of the mycobiome has been limited, but recently it has been demonstrated that it is a key player in the state of health and some human diseases, especially modulating the immune system and producing secondary metabolites in synergy with the intestinal bacteria [<xref rid="B64-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Therefore, a dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota (bacterial and fungal microbiota) will cause the dysfunction of the intestinal tissue, ultimately triggering disease susceptibility [<xref rid="B65-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Recently, a study investigated the intestinal mycobiome in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort and it described that the fungal diversity was relatively low in the stool of the healthy subjects [<xref rid="B66-nutrients-10-01964" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In short, further studies are required to fully understand the potential gut microbiota modification (bacterial and fungal microbiota) that may occur from the consumption of the E82 bread in the prevention of NCGS, as well as other disorders related to gluten.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-10-01964"><title>5.
