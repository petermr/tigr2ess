Gut microbiota are composed of different bacteria species taxonomically classified by genus, family, order, and phyla. Each human&#x02019;s gut microbiota are shaped in early life as their composition depends on infant transitions (birth gestational date, type of delivery, methods of milk feeding, weaning period) and external factors such as antibiotic use. These personal and healthy core native microbiota remain relatively stable in adulthood but differ between individuals due to enterotypes, body mass index (BMI) level, exercise frequency, lifestyle, and cultural and dietary habits. Accordingly, there is not a unique optimal gut microbiota composition since it is different for each individual. However, a healthy host&#x02013;microorganism balance must be respected in order to optimally perform metabolic and immune functions and prevent disease development. This review will provide an overview of the studies that focus on gut microbiota balances in the same individual and between individuals and highlight the close mutualistic relationship between gut microbiota variations and diseases. Indeed, dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated not only with intestinal disorders but also with numerous extra-intestinal diseases such as metabolic and neurological disorders. Understanding the cause or consequence of these gut microbiota balances in health and disease and how to maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiota composition should be useful in developing promising therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>diversity</kwd><kwd>health</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>age</kwd><kwd>milk feeding</kwd><kwd>necrotizing enterocolitis</kwd><kwd>weaning</kwd><kwd>enterotypes</kwd><kwd>irritable bowel syndrome</kwd><kwd>inflammatory bowel disease</kwd><kwd>celiac disease</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>hepatic encephalopathy</kwd><kwd>autism spectrum disorders</kwd><kwd>personalized medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-microorganisms-07-00014"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains an abundant and diverse microbial community that gathers more than 100 trillion microorganisms [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The density of bacterial cells in the colon has been estimated at 10<sup>11</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> per milliliter which makes the colon one of the most densely populated microbial habitats known on earth [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The gut microbiome encodes over 3 million genes producing thousands of metabolites, whereas the human genome consists of approximately 23,000 genes [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For years, scientists have been interested in gut microbiota, but one of the major difficulties in the relevant research has been the ability to culture these microorganisms [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During the last years, new technologies have allowed researchers to phylogenetically identify and/or quantify the components of the gut microbiota by analyzing nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) directly extracted from stools. The majority of these techniques are based on the extraction of DNA and the amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) [<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 16S rRNA sequencing has become the most useful technique to highlight diversity and abundance of the microbiome. The 16S rRNA gene sequences can be exploited with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomics sequencing to characterize the microbial strains [<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Considering the characteristics of gut microbiota such as the large diversity, the stability and resilience, and the symbiotic interaction with the host, we can define the host and the microorganisms inhabiting it as a &#x0201c;superorganism&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] which performs immune and metabolic functions [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Gut bacteria are key regulators of digestion along the gastrointestinal tract; commensal bacteria play an important role in the extraction, synthesis, and absorption of many nutrients and metabolites, including bile acids, lipids, amino acids, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Gut microbiota have a crucial immune function against pathogenic bacteria colonization inhibiting their growth, consuming available nutrients and/or producing bacteriocins. Gut microbiota also prevent bacteria invasion by maintaining the intestinal epithelium integrity [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Microorganisms prevent pathogenic colonization by many competition processes: nutrient metabolism, pH modification, antimicrobial peptide secretions, and effects on cell signaling pathways. Moreover, recent studies have identified a critical role for commensal bacteria and their products in regulating the development, homeostasis, and function of innate and adaptive immune cells [<xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is paradoxical to note that the gut microbiota functions are highly preserved between individuals, whereas each individual&#x02019;s gut microbiota are characterized by a specific combination of bacterial species due to inter-individual and intra-individual variations throughout human life.</p><p>This review aims to define what would be the optimal gut microbiota composition in order to maintain these optimal microbiota immune and metabolic functions. After defining microbiota variations within and between individuals, we highlight the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in various intestinal and extra-intestinal disorder development and we describe the strong relationship between gut microbiota diversity and health. We will see how these gut microbiota variations may have huge implications for intestinal and extra-intestinal disorders and, consequently, may influence health.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-microorganisms-07-00014"><title>2. Gut Microbiota Variations</title><p>Gut microbiota are composed of several species of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast, and viruses. Taxonomically, bacteria are classified according to phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species. Only a few phyla are represented, accounting for more than 160 species [<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The dominant gut microbial phyla are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, with the two phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes [<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] representing 90% of gut microbiota. The Firmicutes phylum is composed of more than 200 different genera such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus,</italic> and <italic>Ruminicoccus</italic>. <italic>Clostridium</italic> genera represent 95% of the Firmicutes phyla. Bacteroidetes consists of predominant genera such as <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic>. The Actinobacteria phylum is proportionally less abundant and mainly represented by the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus [<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Examples of taxonomic gut microbiota composition are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00014-f001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-microorganisms-07-00014"><title>2.1.

The small intestine provides a more challenging environment for microbial colonizers given the fairly short transit times (3&#x02013;5 h) and the high bile concentrations. The large intestine, which is characterized by slow flow rates and neutral to mildly acidic pH, harbors by far the largest microbial community (dominated by obligate anaerobic bacteria) [<xref rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We can observe a microbiota quantitative increasing gradient and a microbiota qualitative decreasing gradient with a progressive aerobic bacteria decrease for the benefit of strictly anaerobic bacteria (<xref rid="microorganisms-07-00014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-microorganisms-07-00014"><title>2.1.2. Infant Transitions</title><sec><title>Birth Gestational Age</title><p>Birth gestational age is a major determinant of gut microbiota colonization. The microbiota composition of preterm infants (&#x0003c;37 weeks of gestation) is different from term counterparts (<xref rid="microorganisms-07-00014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In preterm infants, after birth, the microbiota colonization is challenged by organ immaturity and environmental factors such as antibiotic use, hospital stay [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and enteral feeding [<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For these reasons, the postnatal maturation of gut and systemic immunity may be highly affected by preterm birth [<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In a new-born pig model, an analysis of the gut microbiota composition of preterm and term pigs showed that <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> spp., some <italic>Enterobacterium</italic> spp., <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptococcaceae</italic>, and <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic> were dominant genera in both preterm and term pigs.

Higher levels of Proteobacteria and lower levels of Firmicutes are noted in premature infants of non-secretor mothers [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A recent study by Pratic&#x000f2; et al. [<xref rid="B20-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] characterizing human breast milk composition demonstrated that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) related to different mother phenotypes modulate gut microbiota composition in infants. Specifically, HMOs associated with secretor mothers may have a protective prebiotic effect by decreasing pathogens associated with sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This indicates that HMOs may influence the intestinal microbiota and prevent gut dysfunction and NEC in preterm infants [<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Lactoferrin (LF) is another well-known component of human milk favoring gut infant colonization with beneficial bacteria and consequently representing a crucial role played in preterm infants&#x02019; microbiota [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, correlations between LF and beneficial microbiota in breast milk and infant&#x02019;s feces have been demonstrated [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. High levels of fecal LF, particularly in preterm infants, may represent an important factor in the initiation, development, and/or composition of the neonatal gut microbiota contributing to the immunologic maturation and well-being of the newborn, especially in preterm infants [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, a mother&#x02019;s own milk helps to shape developing core gut microbiota that can improve growth and neurodevelopment and decrease the risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is for all these reasons that human milk should be the primary enteral diet of premature infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Type of Delivery</title><p>At birth, the intestine is sterile and devoid of bacteria. After birth, a rich and dynamic ecosystem develops from mother&#x02019;s skin, vaginal and fecal microbiota, and environment microbiota contacts.

Indeed, an analysis of the meconium of newborn infants [<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] revealed a strong correlation between the microbiota of the newborn digestive tract and the microbial communities of the mother&#x02019;s vagina: <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Prevotella,</italic> and <italic>Sneathia</italic>. Biasucci et al. [<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed that the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants are also characterized by predominant groups such as <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium catenulatum</italic>. Other facultative anaerobic species such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> colonize the infant gut [<xref rid="B26-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>On the contrary, infants born by cesarean section (C-section) acquire bacteria derived from hospital environment and mother&#x02019;s skin: <italic>Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <italic>Escherichia, Shigella,</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species are underrepresented in infants born by cesarean delivery [<xref rid="B29-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>Each healthy human is provided with unique gut microbiota. Core native microbiota are shaped in early life (4&#x02013;36 months) by gut maturation developing from enterotype, birth gestational age, type of delivery, methods of milk feeding, weaning period, lifestyle, and dietary and cultural habits. After a child reaches 2&#x02013;3 years old, a relative stability in gut microbiota composition has been demonstrated. Richness and diversity of gut microbiota shaped in early life characterize a healthy gut microbiota composition. However, this optimal healthy gut microbiota composition is different for each individual.</p><p>Throughout life, the richer and more diverse the microbiota, the better they will withstand external threats. Indeed, gut microbiota represent a changing ecosystem that is severely tested by many factors such as unbalanced diet, stress, antibiotic use, or diseases. A healthy host&#x02013;microorganism balance must be respected in order to optimally perform metabolic and immune functions and prevent disease development. Indeed, disturbances to the delicate host&#x02013;microbe relationship may disrupt the development of the immune system, which may in turn result in diseases [<xref rid="B113-microorganisms-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Although the role of gut microbiota is still poorly understood, the close association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal and extra-intestinal disorders has been demonstrated. This is the reason why dysbiosis can be considered as a biomarker of such disorders and that the study of gut microbiota balances shall be one of the priorities for future therapies to prevent and treat diseases.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, E.R. and M.C.M.; Data Research, M.C.; Data Curation, M.C.; Writing&#x02014;Original Draft Preparation, P.R.; Writing&#x02014;Review &#x00026; Editing, E.R. and M.C.M.; Visualization, G.A.D.M.; Supervision, F.F. and A.G.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-microorganisms-07-00014"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thursby</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Juge</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Introduction to the human gut microbiota</article-title><source>Biochem.
