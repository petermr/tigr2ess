The purpose of this study was therefore, to alleviate this acidic stress through sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) supplementation and determine the corresponding effects on severe-intensity intermittent exercise performance. Eleven recreationally active individuals participated in this randomised, double-blind, crossover study performed under acute normobaric hypoxic conditions (FiO<sub>2</sub>% = 14.5%). Pre-experimental trials involved the determination of time to attain peak bicarbonate anion concentrations ([HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>]) following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ingestion. The intermittent exercise tests involved repeated 60-s work in their severe-intensity domain and 30-s recovery at 20&#x000a0;W to exhaustion. Participants ingested either 0.3&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;bm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or a matched placebo of 0.21&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;bm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of sodium chloride prior to exercise.

Indeed, methods that involve interspersed acute hypoxic exercise bouts within a training programme, are suggested to augment molecular training adaptations leading to enhanced anaerobic glycolytic activity (Faiss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). This benefit is not without cost however, as the lower availability of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) may elicit an ergolytic effect on exercise intensity and volume during intermittent and continuous exercise (Aldous et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>; Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>). The precise reasons causing these attenuations in exercise performance are ambiguous; however, an integrated central and peripheral fatigue response is likely (Fan and Kayser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>). This includes a lower convective O<sub>2</sub> delivery to active skeletal muscle (Amann and Calbet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>), an exacerbated disturbance to acid&#x02013;base balance during exercise (Hogan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>; Romer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>) and under severe hypoxic conditions (&#x0003e;&#x02009;3000&#x000a0;m), a further reduction in group III/IV afferent feedback to diminish central motor output is apparent (Amann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>). The resultant decline in exercise performance presents a challenge to the management of training load during acute hypoxic training regimes to ensure the acute cost to exercise performance does not hamper the potential medium to long-term benefits of these strategies.</p><p>Acute dietary strategies have previously been used to mitigate for the impaired exercise performance caused by acute hypoxia. This includes dietary nitrate supplementation to enhance convective O<sub>2</sub> delivery (Shannon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) supplementation as an alkalotic buffer to dampen the elevated acidic stress (Deb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). The latter presents an interesting physiological paradigm, given the relative increase in glycolytic flux with hypoxic exposure potentiating hydrogen cation (H<sup>+</sup>) production. However, their concurrent removal may be hindered as blood bicarbonate buffering capacity may be diminished under hypoxic conditions, due to a suggested lower bicarbonate anion concentrations ([HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>]) (Cerretelli and Samaja <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>). It is therefore intuitive to assess ergogenic strategies that may facilitate the removal of excess H<sup>+</sup> during exercise and compensate for the suggested [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] reductions. Indeed, Deb et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>) reported that the efficacy of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation is enhanced under acute hypoxia compared to sea level as the magnitude of improvement was greater during high-intensity exercise in acute hypoxic conditions. This should be interpreted with caution however, given that previous studies have either reported no benefit with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> under acute hypoxic conditions (Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014a</xref>; Flinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>), or inconsistencies in the overall ergogenic response (Froio de Araujo Dias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>). Furthermore, there remains considerable contention on the importance of the acid&#x02013;base balance on fatigue and exercise performance, as exercise performance can be maintained despite perturbations in acid&#x02013;base balance (Fitts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>; Westerblad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>). Consequently, further research is required to elucidate the importance of the acid&#x02013;base balance, particularly under acute hypoxic exposures where pre-exercise alkalotic manipulation may induce beneficial performance outcomes for isolated exercise bouts.</p><p>It is evident through viewing blood lactate kinetics during exercise, and corresponding disturbances in acid&#x02013;base balance, that the ergogenic effects of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> may only arise during exercise intensities at or above the severe-intensity domain. This cluster of exercise intensities can be distinguished by physiological markers defined by the second lactate and ventilatory (or otherwise known as the respiratory compensation point) thresholds, or critical power at the lower boundary, whilst the upper boundary is defined as the intensity at the peak rate of oxygen consumption (<inline-formula id="IEq2"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Within this given intensity range, an inexorable rise in lactate occurs and the acid&#x02013;base balance becomes substantially perturbed to performance limiting levels (Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>). Indeed, work performed in the severe-intensity domain during continuous exercise is enhanced with prior NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation (Egger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>); however, this is not reflected in exercise tolerance during severe-intensity intermittent exercise under hypoxic conditions in acclimatised individuals (Kozak-Collins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1994</xref>). The acclimatised participants used in the latter study may explain the lack of effect, given altitude acclimatisation negates the additional acidic load apparent in acclimatised individuals under acute hypoxia (West <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2007</xref>). As the ergogenicity of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is dependent on the magnitude of acid&#x02013;base perturbations, it is hypothesised that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation will improve severe-intensity intermittent exercise under acute hypoxic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><p>Eleven recreationally active male volunteers (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for participant characteristics), with no sustained altitude exposure in the preceding 6&#x000a0;months, participated in this investigation. All participants performed regular physical exercise and were also accustomed to repeated high-intensity intermittent cycling exercise. This included eight participants that regularly partook in cycling exercise (&#x0003e;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;km&#x000a0;week<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and &#x0003e;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;week<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), which is in accordance with the training volume that classifies individuals as trained (De Pauw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2015</xref>), whilst the remaining three participants performed cycling activity as part of a regular exercise regime (&#x02265;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;week<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), which represents volume of work that classifies individuals as recreationally active individuals (De Pauw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2015</xref>). Prior to obtaining written consent, participants were informed of the purpose, benefits and risks of participation. Ethical approval was attained from the institutional ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Participants were instructed to refrain from strenuous exercise and alcohol consumption in the preceding 24&#x000a0;h before each laboratory visit; while also abstaining from caffeine for 12&#x000a0;h. A 24-h dietary recall was completed during the initial visit, with participants asked to replicate dietary intake for subsequent visits. This was confirmed verbally on arrival to each laboratory visit. Participants arrived in a 3-h postprandial state and were asked to maintain water intake prior to arrival to limit confounding nutritional effects on exercise performance.</p><p>

All exercise trials were a minimum 24&#x000a0;h apart and completed within a 3-week period. A normobaric environmental chamber (Model S016r-7-sp, TISS, Portsmouth, UK) was used to recreate ambient hypoxic conditions with a fractional inspired O<sub>2</sub> percentage (FiO<sub>2</sub>%) of 14.5%; while temperature (20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and humidity (40%) was also regulated throughout the study. Participants were exposed to hypoxic air 10&#x000a0;min prior to exercise to allow equilibrium between atmospheric and body O<sub>2</sub> stores (Andreassen and Rees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>).</p><p>During the initial visit, individual blood acid&#x02013;base response to 0.3&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation was established through measuring the time course of blood acid&#x02013;base balance across a 90-min period following ingestion (Gough et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). Sodium bicarbonate was administered in 400&#x000a0;ml of chilled water and mixed with 50&#x000a0;ml of sugar-free cordial (blackcurrant squash, Heritage, UK); with the participants asked to consume the supplement within a 10-min time period. Fingertip capillary blood samples (70&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l) were drawn every 10&#x000a0;min for 60&#x000a0;min and then every 5&#x000a0;min from 60 to 90&#x000a0;min. Participants remained seated during the collection of blood into a capillary tube (Electrolyte balanced heparin clinitube, Radiometer, Denmark). Blood samples were analysed for [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] using a blood gas analyser (Radiometer ABL800, Denmark). The individual time taken for peak [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] to occur was then used for the pre-ingestion timing for subsequent experimental exercise trials.

Subsequently, on separate laboratory visits, participants performed the 3-min test on a further two occasions under acute hypoxic conditions.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>), which involved 3-min unloaded pedalling into an abrupt start of the 3-min sprint phase, during which the ergometer instantly switched to the linear mode. A 10-s countdown was provided to prompt the participants to increase cadence over 120&#x000a0;rpm and to enable the attainment of peak power at the start of the sprint phase. Visual feedback of cadence was available during the test, with participants instructed to maintain the highest possible cadence throughout the test; strong verbal encouragement was provided for the whole test. The linear factor resistance (linear factor&#x02009;=&#x02009;power/cadence<sup>2</sup>) was established using the power output corresponding to 50% of the difference between VT1 and PPO during the RAMP test, along with the individual preferred cadences used during the ramp test. Critical power was calculated on the average power output during the last 30&#x000a0;s of the test and W&#x002b9; as the volume of work (kJ) performed above CP. The test was deemed valid when there was no evidence of pacing; in that, the end 30-s power output was the lowest recorded throughout the test.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ergogenicity of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> during intermittent exercise has only been demonstrated with work intervals involving maximal or supra-maximal intensity (Carr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). Consequently, this study is the first to report that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> improves exercise tolerance and work performed during intermittent exercise in the severe-intensity domain, whilst exposed to acute hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, this study demonstrated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> improves severe-intensity intermittent exercise performance under acute hypoxic conditions. The blood acid&#x02013;base and [lactate] perturbations during exercise observed in the current study are similar to previous investigations (Carr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>), therefore suggesting the ergogenic effects of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is likely to be mediated through the manipulation of acid&#x02013;base balance. The current study also adds to the growing body of literature that has utilised a methodology to elicit peak blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] at the onset of exercise by accounting individual variance in blood acid&#x02013;base kinetics following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ingestion (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>; Deb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Together, this study demonstrates NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation prescribed to account for the individual variance in time to peak blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>], enhances severe-intensity intermittent exercise under acute moderate hypoxic conditions. This therefore may offer an ergogenic strategy to improve high-intensity intermittent exercise tolerance under acute moderate hypoxic conditions.</p><p>This study adds to the paucity of research evaluating the effect of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation on exercise performed in the severe-intensity domain, which have demonstrated equivocal outcomes (George and MacLaren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1988</xref>; Egger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). Egger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>) reported a significant improvement equivalent to 0.41 Hedge&#x02019;s <italic>g</italic> units in 21 well-trained cyclists; whereas George and MacLaren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1988</xref>) found no significant effect in seven healthy participants. This disparity between studies and the positive outcome in the current study, could be explained by a dose-dependent effect of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Given that the current study demonstrated positive outcomes with a relative 0.3&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass dose compared to the 0.2&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass administered by George and MacLaren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1988</xref>). Interestingly, the observed effect on exercise tolerance and work done in the severe-intensity domain in current study was 2&#x02013;2.5-fold greater than that previously observed during severe-intensity exercise. It is important to highlight the use of intermittent exercise in the current study and continuous exercise in previous research may also account for the larger ergogenic effect observed in exercise performance. A proposition that is supported with meta-analytic evidence, with Carr et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>) reporting greater performance improvements with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> during repeated compared to continuous exercise. Nevertheless, a hypoxic mediated effect cannot be dismissed, as the efficacy of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> may be greater under acute moderate hypoxic conditions (Deb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>), due to the exacerbated acid&#x02013;base perturbations (Hogan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>). This hypothesis should, however, be viewed with caution until further research has evaluated the efficacy of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> with normoxic and hypoxic comparators.</p><p>Despite this assertion and the ergogenic outcomes found in the current study, a number of previous investigations have not reported similar performance-enhancing properties of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> under acute moderate hypoxic conditions (Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014a</xref>; Flinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). Flinn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>) performed a similar exhaustive intermittent exercise protocol to the present study, but utilised a supra-maximal exercise intensity under acute hypoxic conditions; while Saunders et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014a</xref>) used a repeated sprint protocol prolonged across 90&#x000a0;min to simulate soccer performance, and found no positive performance effect. This discrepancy between the current study and prior research could be attributed to the timing of administering NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, since both Saunders et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014a</xref>) and Flinn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>) used a gelatine capsule delivery method over a 4-h and 90-min period prior to exercise, respectively. In contrast, the current study accounted for the individual temporal characteristics of acid&#x02013;base kinetics following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation, by ensuring participants commenced exercise tests at the peak blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>], to maximise buffering potential (Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; Gough et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). Indeed, the time course to peak blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] using a gelatine capsule has previously been shown to range from 75 to 180&#x000a0;min and a median of 120&#x000a0;min in a similar participant cohort; while the range from liquid supplementation was between 40 and 90&#x000a0;min in the present study. However, when comparing pre-exercise blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] between current and previous studies it is not clear that utilising an individualised strategy is superior at maximising the ergogenic effect of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The current study reported a mean 6.9&#x000a0;mmol&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>(<italic>g</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.5, 95% CI 2.1&#x02013;5.0) increase in blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] compared to placebo, which is greater than the 5.7&#x000a0;mmol&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>g</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.4, 95% CI 2.9&#x02013;3.8) increase reported by Saunders et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014a</xref>) but Flinn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>) reported a greater 7.6&#x000a0;mmol&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>g</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.4, 95% CI 3.7&#x02013;5.0) increase; despite showing no positive performance effect. Interestingly, the standardised effect sizes and corresponding 95% confidence intervals suggest the effect on pre-exercise [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] was similar between investigations as the confidence intervals overlap. Therefore, while an individualised supplementation strategy may be appropriate to maximised blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] prior to exercise within individuals (Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; Gough et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>); timing may not be the only residing factor that determines the ergogenicity of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation. Further research is therefore required to determine the efficacy of individualised timing against a standardised timing strategy.</p><p>Despite the contemporary development of personalised NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation ingestion time, the adverse gastrointestinal (GI) side effects remain apparent. As evident in participant 9 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), who experienced substantial GI complaints, the side effects of supplementation may produce an ergolytic performance effect. Previous research suggests that the variability in NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ergogenic properties may be dependent on presence and severity of GI symptoms (Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014b</xref>). However, GI complaints and a negative or no performance effect are not always apparent, as the ergogenic and adverse effects of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> have been shown to coexist (McNaughton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>), with Cameron et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>) reporting a weak association between the two parameters (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.35; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09). Given this lack of clarity in this relationship and the failure of the current study to empirically quantify GI complaints, the negative influence of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> can only be inferred in this study as it provides little direct evidence to support the notion that GI complaints from NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation can impair exercise performance or lessen the ergogenic effects.</p><p>Independent of individual exercise performance effects, the temporal blood acid&#x02013;base behaviour following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation and exhaustive exercise, were comparable to the wider literature base (Carr et al. &#x0003c;link rid="bib9"&#x0003e;2011&#x0003c;/link; Flinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014a</xref>; Deb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Oral NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation induced peak blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] concentrations that are greater than 6&#x000a0;mmol&#x000a0;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> compared to placebo, which is above the suggested level required for NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to exhibit an ergogenic effect (Carr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). The change in blood pH and [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] was greater during exercise with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> compared to placebo, with an equivalent larger rise in blood [lactate] during the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> experimental trial. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest NaHCO<sub>3</sub> promotes non-oxidative energy metabolism, as observed through greater muscle lactate production, and muscle glycogen utilisation during intermittent exercise performed in the severe-intensity domain (Percival et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>). Despite not measuring muscle glycogen utilisation or muscle lactate production in the current study, based on previous research it is appropriate to speculate that the observed ergogenic effects of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> may be mediated through augmenting glycolytic bioenergetic contribution, and an enhanced muscle glycogen utilisation. While this is a plausible theory, it is important to highlight that the rise in blood [lactate] during the treatment condition may be explained by a reduction lactate uptake into inactive muscle tissue (Granier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1996</xref>) and/or an increase in lactate efflux from intramuscular to extracellular regions (Bishop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>) following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation. As such, an increase in glycolytic activity can only be speculated in the current investigation. In addition, it is also prudent to highlight that pH at the end of exercise did not reach comparable values in the experimental and placebo trials, which conforms with previous research (Carr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). This suggests that pH may not be the solitary reason for exercise termination in the experimental condition. Given the multi-faceted nature of fatigue alternative explanations may exist; such as the strong ion difference, which refers to the intra- and extracellular ions (e.g. potassium, sodium, chloride) that are involved in skeletal muscle contraction. Evidence suggests NaHCO<sub>3</sub> can alter the ionic charge of these compartments by attenuating the efflux of potassium ions from the musculature and therefore, maintaining muscle contractile properties during exercise (Siegler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2016</xref>). Muscle potassium concentrations were however, not measured in the current study and consequently its role in this context can only be speculated. The SID also has an independent effect on pH (Stewart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1978</xref>), and thus it may exert skeletal muscle performance impairing effects through altering intra- or extra-cellular pH. Further research is required to understand the alternative reasons for exercise termination in the experimental condition despite pH remaining elevated; this may include assessing the function of the strong ion difference.</p><p>It is prudent to highlight the diversity in training status of the participant cohort as both trained and recreationally active individuals volunteered for this study. This does not however, limit the applicability of our findings given the wide-ranging applications of acute hypoxic training methods, from trained athletes (Faiss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>), healthy individuals (Shatilo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2008</xref>) to patient cohorts (Millet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2016</xref>). Consequently, further research investigating the effects of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> as a training aid during acute hypoxic training programs in a range of population may be beneficial. In addition, a limitation to the application of this study may be in the environment at which NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was ingested; in that, ingesting NaHCO<sub>3</sub> whilst remaining under acute hypoxic conditions prior to exercise may have altered the outcomes of the study as opposed to the ingestion under normoxic conditions in this study. Indeed, exposure to hypoxic conditions is suggested to diminish blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] (Cerretelli and Samaja <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>) and therefore, prolonged prior hypoxic exposure may have perturbed the manipulation of the acid&#x02013;base balance following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ingestion. This however, can only be hypothesised until further experimental work investigates the temporal acid&#x02013;base response following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> under acute hypoxic conditions and the subsequent impact on exercise performance. Nevertheless, this study is the first to demonstrate NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation in normoxic conditions can improve severe-intensity intermittent exercise performance under acute moderate hypoxic conditions. Therefore, providing a potential ergogenic strategy for individuals undertaking acute hypoxic exercise bouts as part of training programme. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that ingesting NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at a pre-determined peak blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>] prior to commencing exercise is an efficacious method to enhance blood HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> buffering potential. However, caution should be taken as the adverse GI complaints associated with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> may produce ergolytic effects. To build on the current investigation, further empirical research should consider the use of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> as a training aid during hypoxic training strategies, to determine if repeated acute supplementation prior to exercise alters the molecular training adaptations associated with intermittent acute hypoxic training.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>[HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>]</term><def><p>Bicarbonate anion concentrations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>[lactate]</term><def><p>Blood lactate concentrations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence intervals</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CP</term><def><p>Critical power</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>g</italic></term><def><p>Hedge&#x02019;s <italic>g</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H<sup>+</sup></term><def><p>Hydrogen cation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M19">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
