A human trial to study gastric emptying of staple foods eaten in Bamako, Mali was conducted using a carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C)-labelled octanoic acid breath test for gastric emptying, and subjective pre-test and satiety response questionnaires. Fourteen healthy volunteers in Bamako participated in a crossover design to test eight starchy staples. A second validation study was done one year later in Bamako with six volunteers to correct for endogenous <sup>13</sup>C differences in the starches from different sources. In both trials, traditional sorghum and millet foods (thick porridges and millet couscous) had gastric half-emptying times about twice as long as rice, potato, or pasta (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). There were only minor changes due to the <sup>13</sup>C correction. Pre-test assessment of millet couscous and rice ranked them as more filling and aligned well with postprandial hunger rankings, suggesting that a preconceived idea of rice being highly satiating may have influenced subjective satiety scoring. Traditional African sorghum and millet foods, whether viscous in the form of a thick porridge or as non-viscous couscous, had distinctly slow gastric emptying, in contrast to the faster emptying of non-traditional starchy foods, which are popular among West African urban consumers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>staple foods</kwd><kwd>gastric emptying</kwd><kwd>satiety</kwd><kwd>sustained energy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-10-00124"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Sorghum and millets constitute a main source of nutrition in diets of people living in the semi-arid regions of Africa. These crops are able to grow in droughty conditions and, since mostly disadvantaged people consume them, they are considered by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to be &#x0201c;crops for poor people&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Traditional West African sorghum and millet foods are served in different solid forms (e.g., medium to very thick porridges, couscous, and larger particle size agglomerated products) as well as liquid forms (e.g., thin porridges with and without granules) [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Factors such as urbanization and improved economic status have prompted changes in the dietary habits of Africans, with a shifting away from such traditional foods to imported or Western foods [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This dietary trend in urban areas is termed the &#x0201c;nutrition transition&#x0201d;, and is thought to be a causative factor in the increasing prevalence of obesity and associated diseases (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular disease) [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, high risks of obesity and type 2 diabetes were seen among sub-Saharan African populations living in Europe and in the urban environment of Ghana [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Rapid health deterioration and increases in obesity and chronic disease in sub-Saharan African migrants to Australia were attributed to changes in dietary habits away from traditional foods [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Anecdotal evidence in the region suggests that sorghum and millet foods are filling and provide extended energy after consumption. This is supported by in vitro and in vivo studies showing comparably slow starch digestion in these foods [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In sorghum, low starch digestibility was linked to a protein-starch interaction [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In part, the satiating property of sorghum and millet foods could be due to gastric emptying rate, which is a key regulator of macronutrient delivery to the body and is positively correlated to glycemic response [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It largely affects whether energy is delivered from a meal in a rapid or slow fashion. Several factors directly influence gastric emptying rate, including nutrient content, physical properties (e.g., viscosity, particle size, and texture), volume, and macronutrient properties.</p><p>Sorghum (low or tannin-free types) and millet are commonly consumed in West Africa as thick porridges, and for these foods their viscosity property could slow gastric emptying. Highly viscous foods are thick and resistant to flow; thus, their passage through the stomach may be longer in duration than less viscous foods. Viscous gums are known to reduce gastric emptying rate and postprandial glycemic response [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and highly viscous foods have reduced gastric emptying rate and increased satiety [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Viscosity and volume are associated with satiety [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Yet, not all sorghum and millet West African foods are viscous porridges, such as couscous, and these types of foods are also associated with satiety and fullness. Additionally, sorghum and millet foods are known to have relatively low starch digestibility which might slow gastric emptying by reaching the ileum to trigger the ileal brake mechanism [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that traditional foods of the West Africa Sahel made from sorghum and millet, both viscous and not viscous in nature, have slow gastric emptying compared to non-traditional starchy foodstuffs (rice, potatoes, wheat pasta) that are commonly consumed today in urban areas, which would contribute to a satiety response. A broader aspect of this work is to understand whether sorghum and millet foods of West Africa have positive nutritional attributes, which could be used to promote these grains in urban areas to provide expanded markets for local smallholder farmers. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-10-00124"><title>2.

Subject Selection</title><p>A human study was conducted in Bamako, Mali followed by a validation trial approximately one year later to correct for differences in background carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) in different starchy food stuffs. Pilot data were used to determine the minimum sample size (0.05 level of significance, 0.5 h minimum detectable difference in means, 0.8 power, 0.147 h within subject standard deviation, <italic>n</italic> &#x02265; 4). Eligibility criteria were: males or females aged 20&#x02013;50 years, normal body mass index (BMI, 18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> &#x02264; BMI &#x02264; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), not under any medication, no history of any gastrointestinal disease or surgery, no diabetes, and non-smoking. Fourteen healthy subjects (12 men, 2 women) participated in the main study and six subjects (3 men, 3 women) in the validation trial. Participants were asked to avoid intense physical activity and alcohol consumption the day before and during the test days. For the validation trial, they were additionally asked to reduce or avoid the consumption of C4 plant foods that have higher content of <sup>13</sup>C (e.g., sorghum, millet, maize, and cane sugar-based products) during the testing period. Approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Purdue University (Protocol 1104010761, approved 24 May 2011) and the National Ethical Committee for Health and Life Sciences in Mali, and a written consent form was obtained from each subject before his or her participation in the study. The study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov (ID NCT03007368).</p><p>Subject impressions (<italic>n</italic> = 14) of differences between traditional and imported foods were assessed by a pre-test questionnaire following the completion of the consent form. Information gained from the questionnaire included subject food preferences, consumption frequency, and impressions of satiety effects of traditional and non-traditional staple foods.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-10-00124"><title>2.2. Test Meals</title><p>Six solid foods were tested: white rice (long-grain, not parboiled), plain potato, wheat pasta, sorghum and millet thick (solid) porridges, and millet couscous. Two liquid foods were also tested: millet thin porridges (one plain and a second containing granules (<italic>monikuru</italic>) made from millet flour). Solid test meals were served with a tomato-based sauce made from onions, tomato paste, and fresh tomatoes, plus a seasoning of salt, black pepper, celery, and green pepper. The two thin porridges were served without addition of the sauce. All test meals were prepared on site based on typical preparation methods used in Mali. Rice, potatoes, and pasta were cooked to softness in slightly salted water. Thick porridges, and the plain thin porridge, were prepared from decorticated grains similar to the cooking methods described by Scheuring et al. [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For traditional thick porridge, approximately 4 L of water was boiled in a pot. Traditional potash (10 g) was mixed with approximately 650 mL cold water in a calabash or bowl, to which 750 g of flour (sorghum or millet) was added. The mixture was stirred until homogeneous and then swirled into the pot of boiling water. The boiling mixture was stirred for about 8 min to make a &#x0201c;bouillie&#x0201d; (thin porridge). The heat was then reduced, and about 1300 mL of the thin porridge was removed from the pot and set aside in another calabash. To the boiling thin porridge in the pot, 1250 g of sorghum (or millet) flour was added, one handful at a time. After each addition of flour, the paste was vigorously stirred with a flat wooden spoon. At different intervals of paste thickening, small amounts of thin porridge from the calabash were added. The process of flour addition followed by stirring and further addition of bouillie was continued for about 9 min until all the bouillie that had been set aside in the calabash had been used and the paste was thick and homogeneous. Then the fire under the pot was reduced and the thick paste was allowed to cook for about 12 min until done. For the thin porridge with granules, two-thirds of the flour was mixed with water to make the granules. The granules were then cooked in boiled water, and a slurry was made from the rest of the flour and added to the cooked granules. Lemon juice was added to the thin porridges for taste. Couscous was prepared by first mixing a decorticated coarse millet flour with a small amount of water and agglomerating it by hand to make small fine particles. Particles were then sieved with a medium diameter traditional sieve to obtain particle size uniformity, after which they were steamed in a couscoussier. Before adding the tomato sauce (250 g), <sup>13</sup>C-octanoic acid (100 mg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was thoroughly mixed into each meal portion (650 g) [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Test meals were allowed to sit for 10 to 20 min before being served (serving temperature of approximately 40&#x02013;50 &#x000b0;C). Each subject was allowed to drink 150 mL of water with the meal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-10-00124"><title>2.3.

On the morning of each test day, one of the test meals was prepared with addition of <sup>13</sup>C-octanoic acid as a marker for assessment of gastric emptying rate [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Main Study (<italic>n</italic> = 14)</title><p>Eight test meals were given in replicate tests over 16 consecutive days, with all subjects provided the same meal on each day. Subjects were asked to arrive at the Sotuba Center at 9:30 a.m. and were instructed to fast overnight (&#x0003e;10 h) prior to the testing. Each test meal was given at 10:00 a.m. with instruction to consume as much as they would like until they felt full within a 15 min period [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Breath samples and subjective satiety ratings were collected from each subject in duplicate before consuming the test meal (baseline value), at 15 min intervals during the first 2 h, and then at 30 min intervals until 4 h. The test meals were weighed before and after they were presented to the subjects and from this the energy intake was calculated using food composition tables. The amount of test meal consumed on dry weight basis was converted into energy intake by multiplying the weight of the food by its caloric value [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Using this value, CO<sub>2</sub> production, percent dose <sup>13</sup>C recovery per hour (PDR), and cumulative percentage dose recovery over time (CPDR) are calculated [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B40-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Questionnaire results from the main study (<italic>n</italic> = 14) revealed that 100% of the participants consumed thin porridge with granules once per day as breakfast, while thin porridge without granules was never eaten (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-10-00124-t001">Table 1</xref>). This differs from other West Africa Sahelian countries where plain thin porridges are commonly consumed. The majority of participants reported frequent consumption of thick porridge, rice, and couscous (43%, 43%, and 36% more than once per week, respectively). Fifty percent reported eating thick porridge only once per week.</p><p>Rice was preferred at lunch for 71% of the participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-10-00124-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thin porridge with granules or potatoes were preferred for breakfast (equal response of 43% of participants), while millet thick porridge was preferred for dinner by 36% of participants. In terms of perceived satiating properties, millet couscous and rice were rated highest in the pre-test questionnaire with values of 43% and 36%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-10-00124-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nutrients-10-00124"><title>3.2.

This provided baseline reference data for <sup>13</sup>C in breath CO<sub>2</sub> for <sup>13</sup>C in the C4 plants.

Discussion</title><p>The traditional solid African sorghum and millet foods (sorghum and millet thick porridges, millet couscous) had markedly slower gastric emptying rates compared to non-traditional foods (rice, potato, pasta) that are commonly consumed in urban Africa today. From the validation study, where endogenous <sup>13</sup>C differences in food sources were corrected, gastric half-emptying mean values for the sorghum and millet foods were high (&#x0003e;50% of stomach contents were retained at 4 h; with 50% retention at 5.4 h for sorghum thick porridge, 4.5 h for millet thick porridge, and 5.3 h for millet couscous). Gastric half-emptying times were higher than the 4 h cutoff used by gastroenterologists to indicate abnormality in stomach emptying (severe delay in gastric emptying defined as &#x0003e;35% retention at 4 h) [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Apparently, though, this is normal for sorghum and millet traditional foods, at least for West Africans who normally consume these foods. There was not any indication of abnormality associated with this slow emptying rate, as is noted in the condition called idiopathic gastroparesis [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Although viscosity has been demonstrated in several studies to slow emptying rate [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and this may explain the slow gastric emptying of the sorghum and millet thick porridges, the non-viscous millet couscous meal was also equally slow in emptying. This suggests that there is an intrinsic property of millet and sorghum grains that is associated with decreased gastric emptying rate. For the couscous, there could be a physical property of the particles that creates a movement through the stomach [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], or perhaps a slow digestion of the couscous particles that would trigger the ileal brake [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Indeed, sorghum and millet foods are known to have low starch digestibility, which may deposit glucose more distally in the small intestine [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Of the fast gastric emptying group, all presented low half-emptying and lag times. Perhaps puzzling is that pasta was fast emptying, as it has been reported to have relatively slow gastric emptying [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Likely, this is because the pasta in the study was well-cooked and the texture was soft, rather than al dente pasta that is harder in texture. </p><p>Contents of fiber [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and protein [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] in foods can also impact gastric emptying rate. However, in this study, the sorghum and millet grains used to make the traditional foods were decorticated, a debranning process where the majority of fiber is removed. Moreover, the majority of fiber in these grains is insoluble and does not contribute to viscosity, a factor shown to affect gastric emptying. As for protein, sorghum contains kafirin, which has been shown to relate to the slow starch digestion property of certain sorghum foods [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B59-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]; however, to our knowledge, no previous work has explored its effect on gastric emptying. Overall, there is no evidence that these factors resulted in the marked differences in gastric emptying rates observed in this study. </p><p>In some studies, slow gastric emptying rates have been directly associated with low glycemic response [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], as well as satiation [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. VAS scores on postprandial hunger at 2 h supported millet couscous as being more satiating, though also showed rice to be satiating. Because the pre-test questionnaire showed both to be more filling, perhaps preconceived notions of what foods are satiating may have influenced hunger and fullness scoring. Although protein has been found to increase satiation and satiety [<xref rid="B60-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], small amounts show minimal effect [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] (our test meals were comparably low in protein). Fiber also has been found to have mixed effects on satiety [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and likewise the amount of fiber in our test meals was low, as the grains were debranned. Therefore, it is unlikely that protein or fiber had an impact on the appetitive responses observed. Differences in energy density of the test meals could also have contributed to the gastric emptying rates and VAS scores observed [<xref rid="B63-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-nutrients-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Overall, the faster gastric emptying rates seen in the non-traditional foods tested (rice, potato, pasta) should increase glycemic response, as the starch component enters the duodenum for digestion at a faster rate.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-10-00124"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Overall, traditional West African millet and sorghum thick porridges and millet couscous had substantially slower gastric emptying rates compared to non-traditional starchy foods (rice, potato, wheat pasta) that are consumed in African urban areas today. High gastric emptying times of greater than 4 h, with small variance around means, indicates that all subjects responded to the traditional foods in this way. In the West African context, slow gastric emptying would be considered as a food attribute connected with feelings of fullness and sustained energy.</p><p>As African populations have become urbanized, the change towards a more Westernized diet has been associated with rises in obesity and related metabolic syndrome diseases. The current study shows that in the West African Sahel, replacement starchy staple foods have fast gastric emptying compared to the slow gastric emptying of traditional sorghum and millet foods, and implies that the latter could be beneficial to health by providing energy from a meal over a longer time and imparting a satiety effect. Knowledge of this attribute of sorghum and millet foods could be useful to increase their consumption in West African cities and improve markets for local smallholder farmers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was made possible by the support of the American People provided to the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sorghum and Millet through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
