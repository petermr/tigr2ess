Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors [DT, MMH, SR, SS, SP, AKD, and SSM] of this study are employees of commercial companies [Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Pune, India, Veeda Clinical Research Pvt.

Consequently the health of any individual is dependent (at least to a certain extent) on the dynamics of various microbial communities (referred to as microbiomes) inhabiting a human body. Technological developments in the field of metagenomics have further revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome in health and disease. For example, an aberrant or deviant gut microbiome (one of the most studied microbiomes) has been implicated in several diseases and physiological disorders like enteric infections [<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], obesity [<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Crohn&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Type II diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], colorectal cancer[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], etc. Interestingly, even nutritional and neurological disorders such as malnutrition[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Parkinson's disease[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], schizophrenia[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], etc. are indicated to have a strong microbial basis. Study of different microbiomes, therefore, holds the promise of complementing our existing knowledge of human physiology, and paves the way for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Understanding the structure and function of microbiomes sampled from multiple subject cohorts is expected to provide important insights into the healthy commensal microflora, dysbiotic patterns related to onset of different disease/ disorders, disease susceptibility, impact of various types of co-infections, and on an optimistic note&#x02014;in discovering (and/ or defining) alternate, novel, and improved diagnostic methods as well as therapeutic regimes[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Factors like age, sex, dietary profile, genetic make-up (ethnicity), geographic location, disease status, etc. are known to govern the structure, function, and succession pattern of various microbial communities present on/ within an individual [<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Significant structural and functional variations are therefore expected to exist between microbiomes obtained from individuals belonging to different geographical regions [<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, prior to analysing microbiomes sampled from healthy and diseased states, it becomes imperative to understand the structure and function of microbial communities sampled from healthy cohorts from different geographies. Several individual studies as well as global scale-initiatives have been reported on the gut microbial communities sampled from individuals in developed economies[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this context, it may be noted that, except for a previous study[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with a small cohort size of 34, a comprehensive study from an Indian perspective is lacking.</p><p>The present study aims at filling this gap by performing a gut microbiome study with a cohort of 80 urbansubjects from Ahmedabad city in Western India (hereafter referred to as &#x02018;Western India&#x02019; cohort). Besides helping in cataloguing the repertoire of gut microbes in Western Indian population, it is anticipated that the base-line data obtained in this study will enable in deciphering critical insights with respect to the correlation of the structure of the gut microbiome and various diseases/ metabolic disorders from a regional perspective. The cohort size (n = 80) taken in this study is reasonably large enough to facilitate comparison with datasets from other geographies, and for deciphering distinctive structural and functional aspects of the Western Indian Gut Microbiome. It may be noted that earlier studies [<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] pertaining to region specific microbial community characteristics had more or less equivalent cohort sizes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subject recruitment and selection criteria</title><p>This study was conducted at Veeda Clinical Research, Ahmedabad, India.

At the genus level, 78 unique genera (90% of them common to both time points) are observed to have non-zero median abundance.

In summary, the taxonomic profiles corresponding to the Western Indian gut microbiome indicate a <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominated community that closely resembles (a) the profiles obtained in an earlier Indian microbiome study(19), and (b) the taxonomic composition of gut microbiome samples clustered as 'Enterotype II' (as described in Arumugam et al., 2011[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). Dietary habits prevalent in the Indian subcontinent (and particularly that prevalent in Ahmedabad, the geographic location of the recruited 80 participants) lend credence to this result. The typical diet of participants in the present study included simple and complex carbohydrates (i.e. rice, wheat, sorghum and millet) and fibre-rich components (i.e. fruits, vegetables, whole grains, sprouts, etc.)[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

On the other hand, the fibre-degrading potential of <italic>Succinivibrio</italic> has also been well documented.

Results of this ordination analysis (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g003">Fig 3</xref>) indicate optimal grouping of microbiome sample profiles into two distinct clusters. Although, majority of non-Indian samples segregate into a distinct cluster (hereafter referred to as cluster 1), samples from Japan (in Cluster 1) appear to be spatially separated with respect to samples from other geographies in the same cluster. To confirm this observation, PCoA clustering was repeated using only the set of samples that were tagged to Cluster 1. The Calinski&#x02013;Harabasz (CH) Index, a metric employed for inferring the statistically optimal number of clusters, obtained during this experiment (inset within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g004">Fig 4</xref>) indicates that samples in cluster 1 can be grouped optimally into either 2 or 4 clusters, the CH-Index value being almost similar for both cluster sizes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195643.s002">S2 Fig</xref> depict the results of sub-clustering samples in cluster 1 into two and four groups, respectively. The two observations which are clearly evident from results in these figures are as follows. Irrespective of sub-clustering into two or four groups, the Japanese samples are observed to form a distinct sub-cluster with clear spatial segregation (of Japanese samples) with respect to samples belonging to China, US, and Finland. Samples of the latter three countries, however, do not clearly segregate as per their country of origin, suggesting a high level of similarity between their microbiome profiles. In contrast to results obtained by sub-clustering of samples in cluster 1, performing sub-clustering of samples in cluster 2 (which distinctly harboured &#x0003e;85% of Western Indian samples) indicates formation of 2 sub-clusters, with a CH-Index value of 2 being identified as most optimal (inset within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g005">Fig 5</xref>). However, in spite of sub-clustering, it is observed that samples in cluster 2 do not segregate/ sub-group in terms of sampling time-point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195643.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

The pathway corresponding to 'Starch and sucrose metabolism' (belonging to pathway class 'carbohydrate metabolism') is also observed to be a distinct differentiator between the functional potential of the three clusters. Similarly, a number of metabolic pathways corresponding to pathway-classes 'glycan biosynthesis' and 'lipid metabolism' are observed to be over-represented in the microbiomes of cluster 1b (which are predominated by Japanese samples). In summary, the median abundances of the predicted pathways and pathway classes (emerging as significantly differentiating between the three clusters) appear to have a pattern of distinct functional divergence that grossly corresponds to dietary habits associated to geographies that each cluster represents.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Discussion</title><p>Microbial consortia colonize various sites of the human body.

Recent studies, which have deciphered various taxonomic and functional aspects pertaining to human gut microbiomes sampled across various geographies, indicate interesting associations between (geography-specific) dietary patterns and the composition of the gut microbiome sampled from subjects in specific geographies[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The present study attempts to expand the horizon of existing gut microbiome studies (aimed at cataloguing the repertoire of gut microbes) to the Western Indian geography. A reasonably participant cohort, comprising of 80 individuals residing within the geographical limits of the same city i.e. Ahmedabad, was recruited in the present study. Moreover, samples were taken from each participant at two time points (60 days apart). This study design ensured two aspects. As a country, India, with its large geographical spread, has significant variations with respect to dietary habits as well as climatic conditions[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Given that objective of the present study was to establish base-line data that comprehensively represents at least one of the various dietary preferences prevalent in India, the selection of a subject cohort was restricted to a single region i.e. Western India (particularly the city of Ahmedabad). Obtaining samples at two time points was done with the objective of studying the dynamics and stability aspects of human gut microbiomes within the same individual. A comparison of microbiome samples obtained from the same individuals at two time points indicated no significant alteration of microbiome community structure over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Results of ordination analysis also indicates grouping of samples from both time-points into the same cluster i.e. cluster 2 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g005">5</xref>). Results of (further) sub-clustering of samples in cluster 2 also indicate the high level of similarity of samples obtained at both time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195643.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Further studies will however be required to explore the vast heterogeneity of gut microbial communities within individuals from various parts of India.</p><p>Results of various ordination experiments performed in this study primarily indicate (sub-grouping)and spatial segregation of microbiome samples into two distinct clusters. Although this may be indicative of some extent of correlation of microbiome profiles with dietary preferences prevalent in respective (compared) geographies, the possible contribution of confounding factors (viz. sequencing platform, PCR primers, DNA extraction protocols, target region of the 16S rRNA gene, and various sample collection/ handling methods used in different studies) to the observed spatial segregation cannot be ruled out[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In order to check the impact of minimising (to whatever extent possible) the effect/ bias of the stated confounding factors on the clustering pattern of microbiome samples, PCoA clustering was redone using only those taxonomic profiles that were generated using only the V3 variable region. The latter region was the common variable region within sequencing reads from most of the studies used in this comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195643.s009">S3 Table</xref>). Samples from the Japanese cohort (which employed used the V1-V2 region in their study) were omitted from this analysis. Similar to the overall clustering pattern (as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g003">Fig 3</xref>), results of this ordination analysis (using only the V3 regions) again indicate optimal grouping of microbiome sample profiles into two distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In addition to the re-iteration of the observation that Western Indian samples grouping into a distinct separate cluster, it is interesting to note that samples from the 2 studies in Western India, cluster together despite utilizing different protocols in the two labs.</p><fig id="pone.0195643.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0195643.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>PCoA clustering of microbial abundance data that was generated using only the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequences in various datasets used for comparison.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0195643.g008"/></fig><p>In the present study, an interesting pattern of correlation between bacterial community structure (in terms of species richness) and the functional repertoire of enzymes contributing to various identified pathways (inferred as being present/ functional) was observed. Results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195643.s010">S4 Table</xref> indicate the presence of several differentiating pathways having a higher median abundance in the Western Indian samples (cluster 2). These included starch and sucrose metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, glycine serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, propanoate metabolism, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism. Interestingly, the median abundances of these pathways are null in the other two clusters. For a pathway to be reported by Vikodak (at PEC value of 70) as present/ functional in a sample, various microbes present in a sample should encode at least 70% of genes/ enzymes constituting that pathways. A null median abundance of a pathway in a particular cluster indicates that greater than 50% of samples in that cluster lacked the necessary microbial diversity to encode for the minimum quorum of genes/ enzymes required for the functioning of the pathway. Given this, it may be logical to expect (from results depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195643.s010">S4 Table</xref>) that samples in cluster 2 (followed by cluster 1b) to have relatively higher microbial richness as compared to that in cluster 1. Results of diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g007">Fig 7</xref>) are observed to be perfectly in sync with this line of thought. Microbiome samples in the 'Western India-specific' cluster have significantly higher Chao values (a measure of richness) as compared to samples from other geographies (clusters 1a and 1b).</p><p>Besides the presence of a distinct cluster of genera which have known functional roles in metabolism of butyrate, acetate, and proprionate (as seen in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">results</xref> depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195643.g002">Fig 2</xref>), analysis of correlations between the abundance patterns of various genera identified in the Western Indian gut microbiomes also revealed the presence of a specific subset of &#x02018;independent&#x02019; genera. The abundances of these genera are observed to share no significant correlation with <italic>Prevotella</italic> as well as with the sub-group of genera with known butyrate metabolism capabilities. Most of these &#x02018;independent&#x02019; genera, comprising of <italic>Dialister</italic>, <italic>Catenibacterium</italic>, <italic>Allisonella</italic>, <italic>Hallella</italic>, <italic>Neisseria</italic>, <italic>Oribacterium</italic>, <italic>Megamonas</italic>, <italic>Streptophyta</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, <italic>Olsenella</italic>, <italic>Succinivibrio</italic>, <italic>Rothia</italic>, and <italic>Turicibacter</italic>, are known to be potential pathogens occurring in meagre proportions in a typical healthy human gut. The role of these genera in the Western Indian gut microbiome remains to be probed.</p><p>Two earlier published studies[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] had attempted elucidating cross-geography inferences with respect to the relationship between microbiome composition and the abundance as well as diversity of the carbohydrate/ xenobiotic metabolizing capabilities. In this context, it is interesting to note that Western Indian samples in cluster 2 appear to be highly enriched with bacterial genera that encode functions associated with three other pathway classes, namely 'Amino acid metabolism', 'Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism', and 'Biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites'. Earlier studies[<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195643.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] have indicated associations between the abundances of taxa belonging to phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> with the abundances of two functions, namely, degradation of antibiotics (a classic example of a xenobiotic) and metabolism of complex glycans. The <italic>Prevotella</italic> (i.e. <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>-rich) Western Indian gut microbiomes appear to justify this hypothesized association. These findings justify the need for initiating further 'Whole Genome Sequencing' based studies to probe/ understand associations between various predicted functions and the structure of the Western Indian microbiome.</p><p>Although comparative analysis of microbiome samples (spanning 5 geographies) performed in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195643.s009">S3 Table</xref>) indicate some extent of correlation of microbiome profiles with dietary preferences prevalent in specific geographies, it is likely that apart from diet, several other factors play a role in shaping of the gut microbiome.Further studies will be required to assert this correlation.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec020"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The protocol used in this study was approved by the Anveshhan Independent Ethics Committee (situated at B-8, Simandhar residency, Near Gulab Tower, Behind Utopia school, Thaltej, Ahmedabad-380054, Gujarat, India) with Registration Number ECR/24/Indt/GJ/2013/RR-16.
