Two adjacent 4-ha plots were established with winter rye or winter wheat cover crops in September 2015 at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center (Morris, MN). During spring of 2015, 30 steers were assigned to one of three replicate breed groups at birth. Breed groups were comprised of: Holstein (<bold>HOL</bold>; n = 10), crossbreds comprised of Montb&#x000e9;liarde, Viking Red, and HOL (<bold>MVH</bold>; n = 10), and crossbreds comprised of Normande, Jersey, and Viking Red (<bold>NJV</bold>; n = 10). Dairy steers were maintained in their respective replicate breed group from three days of age until harvest. After weaning, steers were fed an organic total mixed ration of organic corn silage, alfalfa silage, corn, soybean meal, and minerals until spring 2016. Breed groups were randomly assigned to winter rye or winter wheat and rotationally grazed from spring until early summer of 2016. For statistical analysis, independent variables were fixed effects of breed, forage, and the interaction of breed and forage, with replicated group as a random effect. Specific contrast statements were used to compare HOL versus crossbred steers. Fat from crossbreds had 13% greater omega-3 fatty acids than HOL steers. Furthermore, the omega-6/3 ratio was 14% lower in fat from crossbreds than HOL steers. For consumer acceptability, steaks from steers grazed on winter wheat had greater overall liking than steers grazed on winter rye. Steak from crossbreeds had greater overall liking than HOL steers. The results suggest improvement in fatty acids and sensory attributes of beef from crossbred dairy steers compared to HOL steers, as well as those finished on winter wheat compared to winter rye.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-51300-22541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delate</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by the Organic Research and Extension Initiative, grant no. 2014-51300-22541 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Organic beef is the fastest growing segment in the organic industry and increased by 46% between 1997 and 2007. Furthermore, organic beef herds were on a steady increase between 2000 and 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the USDA-National Organic Program (<bold>NOP</bold>) [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], cattle must consume at least 30% of their daily dry matter intake from pasture during the grazing season, except during the finishing phase, which must not exceed one-fifth of the animal&#x02019;s life (up to 120 days). However, there is a high consumer preference for &#x0201c;grass-fed&#x0201d; or forage-finished beef in the United States, which is perceived as more healthy and as having less impact on the environment compared to grain-finished beef [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because of the growing trend in the organic and forage-finished beef market, cattle producers may capitalize on forage for grazing and organic dairy bull calves may represent a potential new resource for organic forage-finished beef in the United States.</p><p>Beef may be a contributing source of unhealthy fats in human diets, like some saturated fatty acids (<bold>SFAs</bold>) and <italic>trans</italic> fats, which are main health concerns among consumers [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, beef also contains many beneficial fatty acids (<bold>FAs</bold>), such as omega-3 (<bold>n-3</bold>) (especially docosahexaenoic [C22:6n-3], eicosapentaenoic [C20:5n-3], and &#x003b1;-linolenic [C18:3n-3] acids) and long-chain <italic>cis</italic>-polyunsaturated fatty acids (<bold>PUFAs</bold>) [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These beneficial FAs have been studied extensively in human diets and play important roles in cardiovascular, cognitive, and inflammatory functions [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Forage-finished beef contains greater n-3 and PUFAs, and a lower omega-6/3 (<bold>n-6/3</bold>) ratio compared to grain-finished beef [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, all nine essential amino acids (<bold>AAs</bold>) important to the human diet are in beef and a greater concentration of essential AAs are found in forage-finished beef compared to grain-finished beef [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Beneficial FAs and AAs in organic and forage-finished beef may influence consumer preference [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; however, some consumers prefer conventionally raised beef over organic and forage-finished beef due to differences in flavor and palatability sensory attributes [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>According to the USDA-NOP [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], all organic farms must maintain an active soil building plan. As more concern is placed on soil health, the emphasis on soil erosion and nutrient leaching have become the main reasons to utilize winter cover crops in rotation with other crops [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the Upper Midwest, winter cover crops may be planted in the fall and grazed early next spring to extend the grazing season for livestock. Cover crops may be a useful strategy because one of the main obstacles that organic and forage-finished beef producers face is lack of supply of high quality forages for pasture-based feed [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Extending the grazing season not only reduces the need to store feed, but the FA profile in muscle and adipose tissue improves as the grazing duration increases [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Increasing the grazing duration with cover crops may help producers provide pasture-based feed, improve FA profiles of beef in terms of human health, and meet the demands for forage-finished beef.</p><p>As the organic forage-finished beef industry continues to grow, it is important to understand factors that affect meat quality, characteristics of beef that influence human health, and sensory attributes of cooked beef. Research on alternative breeds and forage types that influence meat quality, FA and AA profiles, and sensory attributes in an organic forage-finished production system is lacking. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to compare beef from Holstein and crossbred dairy steers grazed and finished on winter rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic>; <bold>WR</bold>) and winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>; <bold>WW</bold>) for meat quality characteristics, FA and AA profiles, and consumer acceptability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>The current study was conducted at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center (<bold>WCROC</bold>) organic dairy in Morris, Minnesota. All animal care and management for this specific study was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Subjects Code number 1411-32060A). The University of Minnesota&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board approved all recruiting and experimental procedures. with human subjects for the consumer panel evaluation of sensory attributes (Number 0906E67481). Participants in the consumer panel provided written informed consent to participate in the study. The research dairy at the WCROC has a 300-head low-input and organic grazing system. Furthermore, the organic dairy has maintained organic certification since June 2010. The pastures in the current study were not irrigated and no soil amendments were applied.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Experimental approach</title><p>Thirty bull calves were born at the WCROC from March to May 2015 and assigned to one of three replicated breed groups at birth. Breed groups were (1) purebred Holstein (<bold>HOL</bold>, n = 10), (2) crossbreds comprised of Montb&#x000e9;liarde, Viking Red, and Holstein (<bold>MVH</bold>, n = 10), and (3) crossbreds comprised of Normande, Jersey, and Viking Red (<bold>NJV</bold>, n = 10). The Viking Red breed was formed by combining the genetic improvement programs for the Swedish Red, Finnish Ayrshire, and Danish Red breeds, which have historically shared ancestry and similar selection criteria. Bull calves were separated at birth from their dams, housed indoors in individual pens, castrated, and fed 2 L of colostrum per 41 kg of body weight twice daily for three days. After three days of age, calves were group housed in large hutches bedded with organic wheat straw. A total of six groups of five calves were established (n = 30). Calves were fed 6 L of unpasteurized, organic milk once daily using a 10-calf Skellerup peach teat feeder (Skellerup Industries, Christchurch, New Zealand) which was washed and disinfected between each feeding. At four days of age, calves were offered starter grain <italic>ad libitum</italic> and were weaned when calves consumed 0.91 kg of starter grain per day at an average age of 10 weeks of age. After weaning, steers were relocated to a loose confinement barn, remained in their respective groups, and were fed an organic total mixed ration diet consisting of organic corn silage, alfalfa silage, corn, soybean meal, and minerals from the time of weaning until 25 April 2016. One NJV steer was removed from the study one month prior to grazing due to death from peritonitis, which was diagnosed by a veterinarian.</p><p>During spring of 2016, dairy steers grazed either WR (n = 15) or WW (n = 14) cover crops in the vegetative state. The WR and WW were planted on 10 September 2015 on two adjacent 4-ha plots. On 25 April 2016, each replicate breed group was randomly assigned to either WR or WW and rotationally grazed until 13 June 2016 for 7 weeks with supplemented free-choice certified organic minerals. The WR and WW cover crops were balanced for steer breed. Briefly, for forage quality of grazed cover crops, the dry matter was lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for WR (21.2%) compared to WW (23.6%). Crude protein was 17.6% and 19.0% for WR and WW, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Total tract neutral detergent fiber digestibility, used to measure the energy of forages, was 56.2% and 55.5% for WR and WW, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.61).</p><sec id="sec005"><title>Carcass measurements</title><p>The dairy steers were sent for harvest and meat fabrication on two separate dates at a commercial abattoir approved for organic harvest (Lorentz Meats, Organic Prairie, Cannon Falls, MN). The first group of HOL, MVH, and NJV steers were harvested on 27 July 2016 and the second group of HOL, MVH, and NJV steers were harvested on 21 September 2016. The steers were harvested at lower carcass weights because of lower marketability of large organic carcasses at high prices. The organic market values carcasses at a smaller weight than the conventional beef market.</p><p>Live body weight was recorded immediately prior to harvest and hot carcass weight was recorded immediately after harvest. Postharvest carcasses were chilled for 24 hours at 4&#x000b0;C according to North American Meat Processors [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] guidelines, and back fat thickness, ribeye area, percentage of kidney, pelvic, and heart fat, marbling, maturity, quality grade, and yield grade were recorded for each carcass.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Strip loin collection</title><p>Each carcass was fabricated according to North American Meat Processors [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] guidelines. One strip loin (<italic>longissimus dorsi</italic>) was removed from each carcass. Strip loins were identified using carcass identification tags during harvest and were followed through fabrication and vacuum-packaging.</p><p>Strip loins were maintained at 2&#x000b0;C during transportation to the University of Minnesota WCROC in Morris, MN where they were aged for 10 days at 2&#x000b0;C. After aging, strip loins were frozen at -20&#x000b0;C until further evaluation of meat quality and consumer sensory attributes. During November 2016, six 2.54-cm thick, frozen steaks were cut from the cranial end of each strip loin at the University of Minnesota Meat Laboratory (St. Paul, MN). The most cranial steak of the six steaks cut from the frozen strip loin was used for Warner-Bratzler shear force (<bold>WBSF</bold>) analysis. The next two cranial steaks were used for the objective color score analysis, and the remaining three steaks were used for the consumer sensory panel.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Toughness determination and objective color score</title><p>Toughness was measured on one steak from each strip loin using the WBSF instrument (G-R Elec. Mfg. Co., Manhattan, KS) at the University of Minnesota Meat Laboratory. Vacuum-sealed steaks were removed from the freezer and thawed for 24 hours at 4&#x000b0;C, unpackaged, wrapped in aluminum foil, and cooked in an electric oven to a final internal temperature of 71&#x000b0;C. Each steak was cooled to 4&#x000b0;C for 24 hours, then warmed to room temperature for two hours. Six 1.27-cm cores were removed from each steak parallel to the muscle fiber orientation using a hand-coring device. The average of the six cores from each steak was used as a single peak shear force measurement for each steer.</p><p>The color of each steak was measured using a HunterLab Miniscan XE Plus spectrophotometer equipped with a 6-mm aperture (HunterLab Associates Inc., Reston, VA). Objective color score values were L* (brightness, 0 = black and 100 = white), a* (redness/greenness, positive values = red and negative values = green), and b* (yellowness/blueness, positive values = yellow and negative values = blue), following procedures established by the Commission International de l&#x02019;&#x000c9;clairage [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Two vacuum-sealed, frozen steaks (two replicates) from each steer were thawed for 24 hours at 4&#x000b0;C, unpackaged, and exposed to the air in 4&#x000b0;C for two hours before measuring color scores. Readings for each of the L*, a*, and b* values were taken at three random locations on the surface of the steak exposed to the light. Readings were averaged for each steak at the time of evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Fatty acid profiles</title><p>Back fat samples (approximately 6.4 x 0.5-cm) were collected from all carcasses 72 hours postharvest at the abattoir. Samples were placed in Whirl-Pak<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> bags (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI), transported on ice at 2&#x000b0;C to the University of Minnesota WCROC, and shipped on ice at 2&#x000b0;C in a polystyrene insulated container overnight to Minnesota Valley Testing Laboratories (New Ulm, MN) for FA profile analyses.</p><p>The FAs were determined according to AOAC method 996.06 [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] by using gas chromatography. Lipids were extracted from a 100 to 200 mg sample of finely ground fat. Pyrogallic acid was added to reduce oxidation of FAs during the analysis. The triglyceride, triundecanoin (C11:0), was added as an internal standard. Lipids were extracted in ether and then methylated to fatty acid methyl esters using Bromine trifluoride in methanol. The fatty acid methyl esters were quantitatively measured by capillary gas chromatography against the triundecanoin standard. Total fat was calculated as the sum of individual FAs expressed as triglyceride equivalents, and saturated and unsaturated fats were calculated as the sum of their respective FAs. Individual FAs are reported in percent weight of the total fat. The n-3 FA is reported as the sum of: &#x003b1;-linolenic (C18:3n-3), eicosatrienoic (C20:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic (C22:6n-3) individual PUFAs. The omega-6 (<bold>n-6</bold>) FA is reported as the sum of linoleic (C18:2n-6), &#x003b3;-linolenic (C18:3n-6), eicosadienoic (C20:2n-6), arachidonic (C20:4n-6), docosadienoic (C22:2n-6), and docosatetraenoic (C22:4n-6) individual PUFAs.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Amino acid profiles</title><p>Meat samples (approximately 6.4 x 0.5-cm) were collected from all carcasses 72 hours postharvest at the abattoir from the strip loin.

The University of Minnesota&#x02019;s Food Science and Nutrition Sensory Center (St. Paul, MN) recruited 108 consumers. Consumers were at least 18 years or older, had no food allergies, and had consumed beef within the past month. All consumers were paid $5 for participation in the sensory panel.</p><p>Steaks were thawed for 72 hours at 4&#x000b0;C in vacuum-sealed packages then unpackaged. Individual steaks were wrapped in aluminum foil, baked to an internal temperature of 71&#x000b0;C, and cut into 1-cm cubes. Each panelist received two pieces of steak per steer group in lidded 30 mL plastic souffl&#x000e9; cups coded with random three-digit codes. To maintain sample-serving temperature, cups were nested in insulated foam trays. Beef from the six steer groups was served to panelists in two sets of three samples on one tray. The first set corresponded to steers grazed on WW, and the second set corresponded to steers grazed on WR. The three breed samples within each set were balanced for order and carryover effects by personnel from the University of Minnesota Sensory Center using a Latin square design with SIMS Sensory Evaluation Testing Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sims2000.com/">http://www.sims2000.com/</ext-link>). Consumers were instructed to consume the first cube and rate it for overall liking, liking of flavor, and liking of texture. Panelists were then instructed to consume the second cube and rate the intensity of toughness, juiciness, and off-flavor. Liking ratings were made on 120-point labeled affective magnitude scales (0 = greatest imaginable disliking and 120 = greatest imaginable liking), with the left-most end labeled <italic>strongest dislike imaginable</italic> and the right-most end labeled <italic>strongest like imaginable</italic>. Intensity ratings were made on 20-point line scales (0 = none and 20 = extremely tough, extremely juicy, and extremely intense, respectively) with the left-most ends labeled <italic>none</italic> and the right-most ends labeled <italic>extremely tough</italic>, <italic>extremely juicy</italic>, and <italic>extremely intense</italic>, respectively. Panelists repeated this process for each of the six steer groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For statistical analysis of carcass measurements, the independent variables were fixed effects of forage and breed, with group nested within the forage and breed interaction as a random effect. Each carcass measurement was averaged for each steer group and the average was used as a single measurement for each group. For statistical analysis of WBSF, objective color score, FAs, and AAs, independent variables were fixed effects of breed, forage, and the interaction of breed and forage, with replicated group as a random effect. Replication number was included in the model for analysis of objective color score as a random effect. For the consumer sensory evaluation and analysis of like/dislike categories, independent variables were fixed effects of breed, forage, and the interaction of breed and forage, with consumer as a random effect. The chi-square test of SAS [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used to obtain percentages for like/dislike categories for the sensory evaluation. The MIXED procedure of SAS [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used to obtain least squares means and solutions for all analyses, and conduct the analysis of variance.

The WBSF values for steaks in the current study are higher than reported by Bjorklund et al.

The NJV dairy steer breed was also comprised of Normande genetics, which may have played a role in similar WBSF values between breeds in the current study. For young beef bulls, WBSF was not different between Angus, Belgian Blue, and Limousin young bulls [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The current study only used one cut of meat to study the differences in toughness and tenderness. Recently, Bonny et al. [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], reported that differences in meat quality depends on the cut of beef, and breed also may influence eating quality of beef. The tenderloin (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>psoas major</italic>) had the highest meat quality score for beef, crossbreds, and dairy breeds. The strip loin, which was utilized in the current study, was rated fourth in meat quality scores out of 16 cuts of dairy beef.

The amount of total fat in the diet may also influence the FA content in adipose tissue of steers. Microorganisms in the rumen may differ based on feeding systems; however, it is likely that the FA content and forage quality of WR and WW pastures contributed to the back fat FA content of steers based on the different FA concentrations among forage species [<xref rid="pone.0187686.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Fatty acids from HOL, MVH, and NJV steers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187686.t003">Table 3</xref>) differed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for myristic (C14:0), tetradecenoic (C14:1<italic>trans</italic>), myristoleic (C14:1), elaidic (C18:1<italic>trans</italic>), gadoleic (C20:1), &#x003b3;-eicosatrienoic (C20:3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA; C20:5n-3), docosatetraenoic (22:4n-6), docosapentaenoic (22:5), and tricosanoic (C23:0) acids.

The greater concentration of long-chain PUFAs in the crossbred steers may have influenced the darker L* score observed in the steaks from crossbred steers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187686.t001">Table 1</xref>) due to lipid oxidation.

This study examined the potential for an organic, forage-based diet, including winter wheat and winter rye grazed for 7 weeks in the spring, to supply adequate nutrition for marketable meat quality of dairy steers. Increased forage in the rations of dairy cattle has been reported to improve the FA profile of dairy and beef products. In our study, the FAs from crossbred steers consisted of a greater n-3 FA concentration compared to purebred HOL steers. Furthermore, a lower n-6/3 FA ratio was found in crossbred compared to HOL steers. In sensory evaluation panels, consumers liked steak from crossbred steers more than HOL steaks, and steak from steers grazed on WW over WR. Steak from crossbred steers rated higher than HOL steaks in overall, flavor, and texture likeness. Toughness and juiciness intensities were rated lower and higher, respectively, for crossbred over HOL steaks. Improvements in the nutritional quality of beef may have the potential to improve consumer acceptability of beef and human health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express gratitude to Darin Huot and coworkers at WCROC for their assistance in data collection and care of animals.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187686.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Dimitri</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Oberholtzer</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Marketing U.S. Organic Foods: Recent Trends From Farms to Consumers</chapter-title>
