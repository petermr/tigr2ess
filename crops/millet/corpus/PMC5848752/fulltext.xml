in nutritional intake has been a major problem in low-income countries. In particular,
sub-Saharan Africa registers high incidences of child stunting and underweight<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Malawi is one of the least developed nations, where the recent rates of
stunting, underweight and wasting are 42, 17 and 4 %, respectively<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Wasting, stunting and underweight are the three popular indicators of undernutrition. Wasting
can be caused by an extremely low energy intake (e.g. due to famine), nutrient losses due to
infection, or a combination of both. Caregivers and health providers can sometimes contribute
to wasting if the child is placed on an improper diet<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Stunting is multifactorial impairment in linear growth that results from
undernutrition, recurrent infections with water-borne diseases, substandard health care and
environmental enteropathy due to improper sanitation<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Underweight is a composite measure of wasting and stunting, and is regarded as
the overall extent of undernutrition among children<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most direct cause for child undernutrition is deficiency in macro- and micronutrients.
Diets dominated by staples tend to lead to deficiency in protein, fat and micronutrients,
particularly the amino acid lysine<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In fact, a survey by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee revealed that
the starchy cereals, primarily maize, account for more than 70 % of daily energy intake in
Malawi<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. By contrast, intake of legumes provides access to all nine essential amino
acids, as well as the B-vitamin group, ascorbic acid and carotene<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Pigeon pea, for instance, has a protein content of 21&#x02013;26 %<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Small grain cereals like finger millet, for example, contains 340 mg Ca/100 g,
three times the concentration in milk<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, is gluten-free and easily digestible by the human body. Legumes and small grain
cereals together would complement maize-based diets and help to achieve improved health and
growth outcomes. Notwithstanding the availability of crops in Malawi, utilisation of such
complementary food ingredients, especially finger millet and pigeon pea, remains low on
average due to food consumption traditions and limited awareness of the nutrient content and
its health benefits. Diets among smallholders in rural Malawi have traditionally been
dominated by a single staple crop, which is maize in most parts of the country and sorghum to
a lesser extent<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Women cook hard porridge called <italic>nsima</italic> from maize and the family
consumes it at home<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Rural households tend to produce such crops as finger millet and pigeon pea for
other purposes such as brewing and trading for economic benefits. Higher consumption of such
crops would contribute to enhancing dietary diversification and better nutritional outcomes.</p><p>Another important factor affecting child growth is food safety. Aflatoxin
(<italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>) is a harmful mycotoxin that contaminates a variety of
food crops<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It alters the cellular and biochemical functions of the intestine, affects
intestinal architecture, inhibits intestinal regeneration, triggers Zn deficiency<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and hinders vitamin A absorption<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Chronic aflatoxin exposure impairs child growth<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> by restraining dietary nutrient uptake<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and suppressing immunity, which leads to susceptibility to endemic diseases<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Forty-five per cent of maize samples from Malawi were contaminated with more
than 4 ppb of aflatoxin, the proposed upper limit for human consumption<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Likewise, 46 and 23 % of groundnut samples collected in Malawi in 2008 and 2009,
respectively, were contaminated<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Improper pre- and post-harvest crop management is the primary factor causing
high levels of aflatoxin contamination in crops<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Aflatoxin levels in man decrease with the degree of dietary diversity and
dependence on single staple foods exposes consumers to aflatoxin hazard<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Moreover, no cases of severe aflatoxin contamination in finger millet and pigeon
pea crops have been reported thus far.</p><p>In addition to nutrition diversification and aflatoxin control, water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) practices also play a fundamental role in improving health outcomes. The WHO estimates
that 50 % of undernutrition cases are associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm
infections caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation and insufficient hygiene<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Our intervention programme adopted the Positive Deviance (PD)/Hearth model, which is a method
of conducting training of mothers through group activities in contrast to individual
counselling. The method was developed and employed in the 1980s<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and was replicated in later years. In this approach, &#x02018;positive deviant&#x02019; (PD)
mothers living in resource-poor conditions who are raising healthy and well-nourished children
are selected to lead sessions attended by small groups of undernourished children and their
mothers living in the same resource-poor conditions<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The aim is to find out the PD mothers&#x02019; practices that allow their children to be
well nourished; for example, the way complementary food is used. Community health
practitioners can then incorporate these PD behaviours into their nutrition programmes,
knowing that the behaviours are both affordable and culturally acceptable since they are
already being practised by members of the community<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In different programmes around the world, the PD/Hearth method has worked to
improve health habits, enhance nutrition knowledge and consequently rehabilitate
undernourished children<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In Malawi, a few non-governmental organisations such as GOAL and I-LIFE have
successfully adopted the PD/Hearth approach in their nutrition programmes to date, although
quantitative impact assessment has not been conducted<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most of the previous nutrition intervention programmes incorporating the PD/Hearth model
entailed qualitative assessment or, if quantitative, descriptive statistics such as
mean/percentage and comparison tests (e.g. <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup> test). Those analyses are useful enough to derive strong qualitative
implications. However, to quantify the programme effects on undernutrition indicators with
minimised estimation bias, it is imperative to employ a more sophisticated method of
quantification of impacts. For this purpose, the present study utilised a combination of the
randomised controlled trial and panel regression analyses. Another unique aspect of our
assessment is that the undernutrition indicators were measured four times during the 21d
intervention programme, including the baseline and endline, which enabled us to monitor how
the effects on different indicators evolved during the programme period. As such, the present
article focuses on the immediate effects of the intervention rather than the long-term
consequences, which will be studied in a separate article.</p><p>While it is widely believed that tangible progress in improving nutritional outcomes and
child health can be obtained through better nutrition knowledge<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">

into improved ones would be accelerated with accumulated scientific and empirical evidence
from the ground.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a training programme
that combined four elements from different initiatives around the world: (i) dietary
diversification using locally produced affordable food; (ii) WASH practices; (iii) food safety
management, specifically aflatoxin control; and (iv) the PD/Hearth model as a method of
information sharing. Furthermore, the effectiveness was quantified by methods beyond
descriptive statistics.</p><sec sec-type="general" id="sec1"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="general"><title>Household survey</title><p>The survey was undertaken during the 2014/15 post-harvest storage period. There is one
rainy season in Malawi that usually ends in April. Although food availability is better
during the post-harvest than during the pre-harvest season, aflatoxin contamination is
more salient in the former due to smallholders&#x02019; unfavourable storage environments. Water
sanitation is also worse during the dry season<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>38</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Purposive sampling was used to select districts based on the extent of: (i) additional
crop (especially legume crops) production other than maize; (ii) aflatoxin contamination
in groundnut and maize<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>

<sup>)</sup>; and (iii) the stunting rate. Two hundred and forty-one mothers/caregivers
who had children aged 6&#x02013;23 months who had started consuming complementary food, had no
congenital disorder and were capable of swallowing complementary food were randomly
recruited from rural communities in Mchinji (<italic>n</italic> 41), Balaka
(<italic>n</italic> 100) and Mzimba (<italic>n</italic> 100) districts.</p><p>A semi-structured questionnaire was converted into the ODK (Open Data Kit) form to
electronically capture the household-level data on demographic and socio-economic
characteristics, knowledge on complementary feeding, WASH, aflatoxin awareness,
ingredients for complementary foods, agricultural practices, and infant and young child
feeding practices, to establish the current knowledge, attitudes and practices towards
hygiene, aflatoxin and nutrition. Seven types of dietary indices were also collected in
accordance with the Household Dietary Diversification Score (HDDS)<sup>(</sup>

assay, while urine samples were collected from the children to assess levels of the
aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) biomarker.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2" sec-type="general"><title>Randomised controlled trial</title><p>The training and follow-up measurements were conducted in Mzimba and Balaka districts.
Among the 200 households in these districts at baseline, 179 households that explicitly
showed interest participated in the randomised controlled trial whereby ninety-one
households (forty-six from Mzimba and forty-five from Balaka) were randomly assigned to
the intervention group and the remaining eighty-eight to the control group. In the study,
there was one intervention group that received the intervention programme and one control
group that did not. On the day before the start of the trial (i.e. day 0), anthropometric
measurements were collected from the children and their 24 h dietary recall was also
recorded. During the 21d trial, information on disease incidences and food acceptability
was collected every day, while follow-up anthropometric measurements were registered on
day 7, day 14 and day 21. The contents and schedule of the intervention programme can be
found in the &#x02018;Training programme&#x02019; subsection below.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="general"><title>Indicators of child undernutrition</title><p>The <italic>Z</italic>-scores for wasting, stunting and underweight<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>41</sup>

<sup>)</sup> were adopted as main indicators of child undernutrition. Anthropometric
measurements were conducted on all children participating in the study. Their height,
weight and age were used to calculate their weight-for-height <italic>Z</italic>-score
(wasting), height-for-age <italic>Z</italic>-score (stunting) and weight-for-age
<italic>Z</italic>-score (underweight), which were calculated using WHO Anthro software
version 3.2.2. Children were categorised as severely undernourished, moderately
undernourished and overnourished if the corresponding <italic>Z</italic>-score was below
&#x02212;3&#x000b7;0, between &#x02212;3&#x000b7;0 and &#x02212;2&#x000b7;0, and above +2&#x000b7;0, respectively. <italic>Z</italic>-scores
between &#x02212;2&#x000b7;0 and +2&#x000b7;0 indicate normal nutritional status. Additionally, mid-upper arm
circumference (MUAC), which indicates the muscle mass of the upper arm, was also measured.
According to the WHO standard, wasting and MUAC are considered as criteria for severe
acute undernutrition, while stunting indicates chronic undernutrition<sup>(</sup>

height, recumbent length measurements were adopted using a stadiometer. MUAC was measured
to the nearest 0&#x000b7;1 cm using a MUAC tape wrapped around the mid-upper arm.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4" sec-type="general"><title>Crop sample collection and aflatoxin B1 assay</title><p>One hundred grams of maize grains that would have been used for complementary food
preparation were collected from each of the sampled households for aflatoxin detection.
During sample collection, a representative sample was obtained by mixing ten sub-samples,
each weighing 10 g and collected from different parts of each storage bag, to constitute a
sample of 100 g that was used to assay for aflatoxin contamination. The 100 g samples were
weighed and powdered finely, and then two replicate samples of about 20 g each were mixed
with 100 ml of 70 % methanol (v/v) containing 0&#x000b7;5 % potassium chloride (w/v) and were
blended further. The mixture was then transferred to a 250 ml conical flask, shaken at 300
rpm for 30 min (Gallenkamp Orbital Shaker, CAT # SCM 300 0101, UK) and filtered through
Whatman No. 41 filter paper (GE Healthcare, UK). The filtrate was then analysed using
indirect competitive ELISA using a ninety-six-well ELISA plate (F96 MAXISORP; Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Denmark) as indicated earlier<sup>(</sup>

aflatoxin B1&#x02013;bovine serum albumin conjugate. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit
antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used as a secondary antibody and
<italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a substrate. The
colorimetric reaction was measured in an ELISA plate reader (Multiscan Reader; Thermo
Fisher Scientific, China) at 405 nm.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5" sec-type="general"><title>Urine sample collection and aflatoxin biomarker assay</title><p>Each mother in the study was provided with urine sample collection vials and was advised
to collect early-morning urine samples of her child. These vials were collected from the
mothers immediately and transported to the ICRISAT laboratory in an ice box. The urine
samples were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until use. The analysis was performed using a commercial
ELISA kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. The urine samples
collected from children were given lab numbers and filtered, and the clear solution was
taken for the analysis. The AFM1 standards provided in the kit (0&#x000b7;0, 0&#x000b7;15, 0&#x000b7;40, 0&#x000b7;8, 1&#x000b7;5
and 4 ng/ml) and the urine samples collected from the children were aliquoted 1:20 (50
&#x000b5;l+950 &#x000b5;l distilled water) into 2 ml microfuge tubes. Then 100 &#x000b5;l of each sample/standard
was added to mix wells (provided in kit) with 200 &#x000b5;l of assay buffer, using the
multichannel micropipette three to five times. Then 100 &#x000b5;l was taken from each well and
added to AFM1 antibody-coated wells of the ELISA plate provided in the kit. After an hour
of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the plate was washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline&#x02013;Tween. One hundred microlitres of horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added to
each well, incubated for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline&#x02013;Tween. Finally,
100 &#x000b5;l of the tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added to each well and stored in a dark
place for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding stop solution, the yellow colour
intensity was read using the plate reader at 450 nm, and then the urine AFM1 concentration
was calculated by plotting against the standards.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6" sec-type="general"><title>Training programme</title><p>The PD/Hearth model was adopted for delivering education to mothers on dietary

facilitators to share with the mothers the importance of different micro- and
macronutrient contents in complementary feeding, good hygienic practices, how to choose
quality grains to reduce aflatoxin exposure, and how to formulate and prepare porridge
from diversified food groups using locally available ingredients. The training was

</p></sec><sec id="sec1-7" sec-type="general"><title>Analytical methods</title><p>To quantify the effects of the training, regression analysis was employed, which allowed
us to control for covariates and to obtain standard errors for the treatment effect.
Furthermore, our sampling design enabled us to adopt the difference-in-difference model,
which is a capable tool to estimate treatment effects by systematically comparing the pre-
and post-treatment differences in the outcome between a treatment group and a control
group. The difference-in-difference estimation can be utilised only in the presence of
multiple-period data sets<sup>(</sup>

<sup>,</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Moreover, in our case, unobservable time-invariant household characteristics
(i.e. fixed effects) can be controlled for since household-level panel data were
available, which is a remarkable advantage in minimising estimation bias<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In our study, there are four time points: i.e. <italic>t</italic>=day 0, day
7, day 14 and day 21. Therefore, there are three difference-in-difference dummy variables
corresponding to day 7, day 14 and day 21, with day 0 being the base.</p><p>The most important assumption with the difference-in-difference estimation is the
parallel trends assumption. Provided this assumption holds and we can credibly rule out
any other heterogeneous changes over time that may confound the treatment, then the
estimators are highly reliable. This assumption holds better when the measurement interval
is short, which is the case with our study. All the quantitative analyses, both regression
and descriptive statistics, were handled with the statistical software package STATA
version 14.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="general"><title>Current practices</title><sec id="sec2-1-1" sec-type="general"><title>Socio-economic profile and farming practices</title><p>The sampled children had an equal gender balance, with the mean age being 8&#x000b7;5 months.

</p><p>For wasting, the impacts of the training were found to be insignificant on day 7 and
significant on day 14 and day 21, with the largest magnitude observed on day 21. The
result clearly indicates that the continued good practice enforced by the training led to
alleviating the status of wasting among the children. The quantitative interpretation is
that receiving the continued training raises the <italic>Z</italic>-score for wasting by
0&#x000b7;85 within 3 weeks, which appears to be a remarkable effect given the short period of
time. Besides, all the children in the intervention group underwent a positive change in
wasting during the 21d training.</p><p>By contrast, for stunting the impacts did not reach significance within the 21d time
frame, which is comprehensible since height is much less variable than weight even for
children in the growth phase. It should be noted, however, that the <italic>P</italic>
value decreased largely from day 14 to day 21, suggesting that the effect would become
significant over a slightly longer time horizon. In fact, a change was observed among
moderately stunted children. Six out of the eleven children who had been moderately
stunted at the beginning of the training registered improvement in their height during the
3-week training period.</p><p>For underweight, the impacts were similar to those in the case of wasting. The only
difference is that the effect was already weakly significant on day 7, as indicated by the
panel regression output. Quantitatively, receiving the continued training raised the
<italic>Z</italic>-score for underweight by 0&#x000b7;73 on average, in a matter of 3weeks.</p><p>For MUAC, positive and significant impacts were found on day 21. Although there was no
sign of improvement until day 14, the effect emanated in the third week of the
intervention. Quantitatively, receiving the continued training raised the mean MUAC by
1&#x000b7;92 cm within 3weeks, although the growth was invisible until the second week of improved
practice.</p><p>Apart from the impacts on the undernutrition indicators, the frequency of diarrhoea
decreased significantly after the first week of the training only in the intervention
group, indicating that the hygiene practices were effective as far as diarrhoea was
concerned. Furthermore, the dietary diversity score increased from 2&#x000b7;0 to 4&#x000b7;0, suggesting
the usefulness of the complementary food used in the intervention composed of diverse and
nutritious ingredients such as legumes, coarse cereals, vitamin A-rich vegetables and
green leafy vegetables.</p><p>Lastly and very importantly, the recommended recipes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) were met with the acceptability rate of 82 % in the intervention group.
Children were particularly fond of Recipe 2 described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>All recruited participants from both districts were engaged in maize production as maize is
their staple food stored throughout the year. This explains why most of the infants and
young children received whole-grain maize porridge as a complementary diet. The descriptive
statistics also suggest that the sampled households were poor, and the dietary diversity was
limited. The government and non-governmental organisations in Malawi have been promoting
enriching maize flour porridge with other ingredients such as groundnut flour, soya flour,
cooking oil and vegetables. However, child undernutrition rates remain unacceptably high,
which implies that despite the promotion, adoption of diversified diets is slow, and that
food safety and hygiene practices also need to be addressed, e.g. acute and chronic
illnesses caused by poor hygiene, insufficient time taken by mothers on child care, and
aflatoxin contamination.</p><p>Aflatoxin was detected in the urine samples of more than half of the children, while high
contamination was found in maize samples from a quarter of the households. Given that there
are two channels of aflatoxin absorption by children, i.e. complementary feeding and
breast-feeding, our statistics suggest that there had been transmission of aflatoxin from
mothers via breast-feeding as well. Moreover, consuming poor-quality food containing
grade-outs as described by the study participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table
2</xref>) leads to increased aflatoxin exposure as likelihood of the presence of aflatoxin
in grade-outs is high<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>47</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In the present study aflatoxin exposure among children was significantly
associated with wasting status, which is consistent with a study conducted in West
Africa<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>37</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> that reported a strong association between aflatoxin exposure upon weaning and
impaired growth of children.</p><p>At baseline, diarrhoea was rampant due to unclean water and other improper sanitation
factors. Yet, the intervention contributed to quickly reducing the incidence of diarrhoea,
which is regarded as an indirect cause for undernutrition. This indicates the effectiveness
of the improved hygiene practices covered by the training.</p><p>The regression results proved the positive effects of the comprehensive training on the
indicators of undernutrition among children, particularly wasting, underweight and MUAC. The
3-week training was conducive to increasing the <italic>Z</italic>-scores for wasting and
underweight by 0&#x000b7;85 and 0&#x000b7;73, respectively, and MUAC by 1&#x000b7;92 cm on average. Albeit less
significant, the result on stunting suggests a positive sign that behavioural changes
arising from continuous feeding of a safe and balanced diet can also benefit height in a
longer time frame. Although the health outcome of the training was positive, it is worth
considering the acceptability of the recipe used. In our case, four out of five households
in the intervention group accepted the recipe, indicating promising potential for upscaling
similar capacity-building programmes. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in
the recipe by incorporating the preferences of the remaining fifth, so that the knowledge
dissemination would be sustainable.</p><p>There are three major limitations in the present study. First, since the study focused on
the impacts of the comprehensive training, there was only one treatment group which received
the entire package of intervention. In other words, the impact of a specific subject of
training was not distinguished from that of another subject. Hence, there remains a question
as to the extent to which each subject of training was effective and what synergy the
combination of subjects brought forth. Second, since our focus was on the real-time impacts
of the 3-week programme, longer-term impacts were beyond the scope of the study. The
sustainability of the effects of the training would require further attention. These two
remaining themes will be studied and documented in another article. Third, the blood
aflatoxin&#x02013;albumin biomarker is a more appropriate measure for chronic exposure status over
the past few months<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>48</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In our case, however, the mothers were willing to provide urine samples only
and hence the urine aflatoxin biomarker (AFM1) was employed, which is an indicator of 24 h
exposure of aflatoxin contamination through food.</p><p>Another factor to note is that the present study employed common and conventional measures
of undernutrition (wasting, stunting) and their composite (underweight). However, Nandy and
Miranda<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> argue that results on underweight can be contradictory to results on wasting
and stunting, and suggest use of the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) which
is always consistent with the conventional indicators. Our result on underweight may alter
to some extent with use of the CIAF. Nevertheless, in light of the consistency observed in
our results between underweight and the two conventional indicators, the result and
implication, arguably, would not change to a significant extent. Since the CIAF incorporates
the failure in height-for-age which is not expected to change drastically within 3weeks, it
may mask the short-term phenomena in our study.</p><p>Lastly, the children&#x02019;s acceptability of Recipe 2 was high presumably due to the inclusion
of pigeon pea and finger millet which were absent in Recipe 1. In particular, pigeon pea
seemed to enhance the taste of the porridge in Recipe 2. The cereals and legumes chosen in
Recipe 2 complement each other for protein and micronutrient requirements, which is absent
in the usual maize porridge prepared by mothers. Details on the acceptance and nutrient
contents of different recipes are beyond the scope of the present study, but will be
illustrated in another ongoing study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Undernutrition in children has been detrimental to economic and social development in
low-income countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. In an attempt to accumulate empirical
evidence, the current paper offered the first quantitative estimation from Malawi of the
impacts on undernutrition indicators of an intervention incorporating the PD/Hearth approach
in which the mothers were educated on three subjects: diversified complementary diets,
hygiene and food safety. A randomised controlled trial and difference-in-difference
regression revealed significant improvement in health outcomes within 21d by virtue of the
comprehensive training implemented. Moreover, the article presented the first results on
aflatoxin assay of children&#x02019;s urine in Malawi, showing that more than half of the sampled
children were contaminated with aflatoxin.</p><p>The results unequivocally suggest that the comprehensive training immediately led to
behavioural changes among mothers and that the improved practices took progressive effects
in ameliorating children&#x02019;s undernutrition. Direct observation of the immediate outcome will
convince mothers to maintain the good practices that are affordable in the communities.
Further elicitation and incorporation of local preferences and tastes would help guarantee
sustainable adoption. In all likelihood, the result implies the need for policies and
institutions to incentivise development agencies and governments to invest in upscaling
intervention programmes of this sort targeted at relevant mothers in resource-poor rural
communities.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>
