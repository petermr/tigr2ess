Bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) is a sequencing approach that provides quantitative cytosine methylation levels in genome-wide scope and single-base resolution. However, genomic variations such as insertions and deletions (indels) affect methylation calling, and the alignment of reads near/across indels becomes inaccurate in the presence of polymorphisms. Hence, the simultaneous detection of DNA methylation and indels is important for exploring the mechanisms of functional regulation in organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">These problems motivated us to develop the algorithm BatMeth2, which can align BS reads with high accuracy while allowing for variable-length indels with respect to the reference genome. The results from simulated and real bisulfite DNA methylation data demonstrated that our proposed method increases alignment accuracy. Additionally, BatMeth2 can calculate the methylation levels of individual loci, genomic regions or functional regions such as genes/transposable elements. Additional programs were also developed to provide methylation data annotation, visualization, and differentially methylated cytosine/region (DMC/DMR) detection. The whole package provides new tools and will benefit bisulfite data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">BatMeth2 improves DNA methylation calling, particularly for regions close to indels. It is an autorun package and easy to use. In addition, a DNA methylation visualization program and a differential analysis program are provided in BatMeth2. We believe that BatMeth2 will facilitate the study of the mechanisms of DNA methylation in development and disease.

Bisulfite sequencing applies a bisulfite treatment to genomic DNA to convert nonmethylated cytosines to uracils, which can be sequenced as thymines (T). Methylated cytosines cannot be converted to uracils and are sequenced as cytosines (C). In this way, methylated and nonmethylated Cs can be distinguished. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) is a method to convert nonmethylated cytosines into thymines for DNA methylation detection at single-base resolution, a process that has substantially improved DNA methylation studies. However, bisulfite conversion introduces mismatches between the reads and the reference genome, which leads to slow and inaccurate mapping. In the last few years, a number of tools have been developed for BS-read alignment, such as BatMeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], BSMAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Bismark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], BS-Seeker2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], BWA-meth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], BSmooth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and Biscuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Structural variations (SVs) play a crucial role in genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Many SVs are associated with cancers and genetic diseases such as psoriasis, sporadic prostate cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer and small-cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Insertions and deletions (indels) are the second most common type of human genetic variants after single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Many human inherited diseases have been reported to be related to indels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recent results show that the indel rate in the human genome is approximately 1 in 3000&#x02009;bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. If we cannot align indel-containing reads accurately, the resulting misalignments can lead to numerous errors in the downstream data analysis and directly affect the calling of DNA methylation, which leads to incorrect results. Because DNA methylation and indels both play important roles in development and diseases such as cancer, it is necessary to detect them simultaneously.</p><p id="Par7">However, the current methylation callers fail to accurately align reads to indel regions. BSMAP can detect only indels with lengths less than 3 nucleotides. Other tools, such as BWA-meth (which uses BWA-mem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] as the fundamental mapping tool), use seeding approaches. These methods assume that the seeds have no indels. Hence, they cannot obtain the correct results when sequencing reads contain multiple mismatches and indels. As a result, we were motivated to study the alignment performance of the published methods on reads with and without indels. Based on the &#x02018;Reverse-alignment&#x02019; and &#x02018;Deep-scan&#x02019; ideas in BatAlign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we developed the DNA methylation mapping tool BatMeth2, which is sensitive to indels in bisulfite DNA methylation reads. In addition, we also provided programs for DNA methylation data annotation, visualization and differentially methylated cytosine/region (DMC/DMR) detection to facilitate DNA methylation data analysis. The package BatMeth2 is designed to be an easy-to-use, autorun package for DNA methylation analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Implementation</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bisulfite sequencing read alignment with BatMeth2</title><p id="Par8">The basic alignment tool underlying BatMeth2 is the alignment program BatAlign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which works as follows. First, converted reference genomes and converted input sequences are prepared with all Cs in the reference genomes, and input sequences are converted to Ts. Because the plus and minus strands are not complementary after Cs are converted to Ts, two converted reference genomes are prepared, where one is for the plus strand of the original reference genome and the other is for the minus strand of the original reference genome. The indexes are built for these two converted reference genomes. Many existing approaches first find putative hits for the short seeds of the input reads by performing exact alignment or 1-mismatch alignment of the seeds. When the short seeds have two or more mutations, the putative hits of the short seeds may not represent the correct locations of the input reads. To address the limitation of missing alignment hits with low edit-distance short seeds, BatMeth2 finds hits of long seeds from the input reads allowing a high edit-distance (long seeds of 75&#x02009;bp, five mismatches and one gap allowed). When the input sequence is shorter than 150&#x02009;bp, the candidate hits of the 75&#x02009;bp seed are searched and then extended to their original full read length. When the input read is longer than 150&#x02009;bp, multiple nonoverlapping 75&#x02009;bp seeds are used to search for candidate hits. These hits are extended, and then, the best alignment is selected on the basis of a set of predefined criteria, including the mismatch number and the number of mapping hits. For the calculation of the alignment score, the penalty for a gap is exactly the same as the penalty for 1.5 mismatches. If the number of &#x0201c;detected mismatches&#x0201d; in a read is smaller than the mismatch threshold, the detection of indels will not be conducted unless there is no appropriate alignment result for the read. (When there is a mismatch alignment of a read with a small number of mismatches, it is better than an alignment with indels. Hence, it is unnecessary to obtain a gapped alignment.) When the allowed number of mismatches is greater than the mismatch threshold, BatMeth2 will detect indels and report the alignment hit. This algorithm will not sacrifice accuracy, yet it is more efficient. Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 outlines the details of the BatMeth2 algorithm.</p><p id="Par9">The final alignment between a read and the reference genome is based on an affine-gap scoring scheme, where the score for a match or a mismatch is the Phred scaled value at this position. The gap opening penalty and the gap extension penalty are 40 and 6, respectively.</p><p id="Par10">In reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), the genomic DNA is first fragmented by enzymatic digestion (e.g., MspI), followed by a size selection step to enrich the fragments for CpG islands. Therefore, in BatMeth2, we partition the genome by enzymatic digestion site (e.g., C-CGG for MspI); then, we index only the reduced representation genome regions, which are fragment regions that are shorter than the predefined value, which is 600 by default. We map the RRBS reads by building special enzymatic digestion indexes with improved efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods for aligning reads across the breakpoints of small insertions and deletions (indels)</title><p id="Par11">BatMeth2 starts scanning for the most likely hits for a read in the reference genome by using &#x02018;Reverse-alignment&#x02019;. The current alignment methods mostly use seed-and-extend approaches. They first align short seeds allowing 0 or 1 mismatch; then, the seeds are extended. When the alignment of the read contains multiple mismatches and/or indels, the current solutions may fail. To avoid this problem, our approach is to align a long seed (default 75&#x02009;bp) allowing more mismatches and gaps (by default, we allowed five mismatches and one gap). In addition, for aligning paired-end reads, the best hit for an individual read is not necessarily the best alignment result for the paired-end reads. In this case, we need to consider the alignment results of both reads at the same time. Therefore, after we obtain the least-cost (highest Smith-Waterman score) hit for each read, we continue to search for more alignment hits and finally choose the appropriate alignment results according to the paired-end sequence alignment. This method is called &#x02018;Deep-scan&#x02019; and is described in BatAlign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Among the hits of both reads, BatMeth2 finds the best hit pair and reports it.</p><p id="Par12">If a read spans a genomic rearrangement breakpoint, many mismatches between the read and the genome may occur, which will cause the alignment score to be negative. In this case, we will remove some part of this read (soft-clipping). When the soft-clipped length is greater than 20, we will realign the clipped portion of the read (allowing for 0 mismatches) and obtain auxiliary alignments. The chosen auxiliary alignment and the primary alignment of the read together will represent a complete alignment of the original read.</p><p id="Par13">The main differences between BatMeth2 and BatMeth are as follows: 1) BatMeth2 supports gapped alignment with an affine-gap scoring scheme, while BatMeth finds only ungapped alignments. 2) BatMeth2 supports paired-end alignment, while BatMeth can align only single-end reads. 3) BatMeth2 supports characterizing the alignment hits with a mapping quality report. 4) BatMeth2 supports local alignment, which does not require reads to align end-to-end. Therefore, BatMeth2 can remove some part of this read (soft-clipping) based on the alignment score.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Calculation of methylation levels</title><p id="Par14">To calculate the methylation density, we first count the total number of C/T nucleotides that overlap with each cytosine site on the plus strand and the number of G/A nucleotides on the minus strand. Those cytosines, which are used for further statistical analysis, should meet the criterion that their depth (C plus T) should be more than some predefined threshold (by default, 5) to reduce the influence of sequencing errors in the cytosine site. In addition, we know that there may be a SNP variation from cytosine (C) to thymine (T), which may affect the calculation of methylation levels in the cytosine loci. To determine whether a site contains a C-to-T bisulfite conversion or a C-to-T SNP, we need to consider the reverse complement strand simultaneously. If the cytosine site is a methylation, it will change from C to T after bisulfite treatment, while the reverse complement strand (rev) should be G. Conversely, if the site is a C-to-T SNP, the rev should be A. Therefore, we calculate the methylation level (ML) by the following equation, which was used in the BSMAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] program:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

These datasets were simulated from the human genome (UCSC hg19) using FASTX-mutate-tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], wgsim (v0.3.0) and the simulator in SAMtools (v1.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which allows 0.03% indels, a 1% base error rate in the whole genome and a maximum of two mismatches per read. We mapped the simulated reads to the reference genome, allowing at most two mismatches. Because the original positions of the simulated reads were known, we could evaluate the accuracy of all the programs by comparing their mapping outputs with the original positions.</p><p id="Par23">To compare the performances of the different software, a sequencing read with indels was considered correctly mapped if the following conditions were true: 1) the read was uniquely mapped to the same strand as it was simulated from and the mapping quality was greater than 0; 2) the reported starting position of the aligned read was within ten base pairs of the original starting position of the simulated read; 3) the mapping results had similar indels or mismatches to the simulated read. If any of these conditions were violated, the read was considered wrongly mapped. Because BatMeth2 allows one gap in the seed region, it can find seed locations incorporating indels with high accuracy and can avoid mismatched locations, which would cause reads incorporating indels to be misaligned. The results in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show that BatMeth2 achieved the largest number of correctly aligned reads and the lowest number of incorrectly aligned reads in all test datasets at different bisulfite conversion rates.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Evaluation of all BS-Seq aligners using simulated datasets with different read lengths from FASTX and wgsim.

Hence, we aligned these real data using single-end reads from the paired-end datasets and evaluated the concordant and discordant mapping rates from the paired alignments to estimate the correct and incorrect alignment rates. Because the insert size of the paired-end reads was approximately 500&#x02009;bp, a pair of partner reads could be considered concordant if they were mapped within a nominal distance of 500&#x02009;bp; otherwise, a pair of partner reads could be considered discordant.

Therefore, to verify whether BatMeth2 can align BS reads with indels of different lengths, we downloaded WGBS data (75 Gbases) and 450&#x02009;K Bead Chip data from HepG2 (liver hepatocellular carcinoma, a cancer cell line) from ENCODE. We checked the indel length distribution in the reads after the alignment of HepG2 WGBS-Seq data. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3A shows that the lengths of the detected indels were mainly distributed in the 1&#x02009;bp~&#x02009;5&#x02009;bp range, and the longest indel was 40&#x02009;bp in length. According to our statistics, 2.3% of the alignment reads contained indels. From these results, we know that BatMeth2 can align reads with indels of different lengths.</p><p id="Par30">Next, we tested the effect of indel detection on DNA methylation calling. For BatMeth2, we ran two options on the HepG2 data: with and without indel detection (i.e., set -I parameter in BatMeth2). We also ran Bismark on the WGBS-Seq data from HepG2 as a reference for DNA methylation calling with indel detection, because Bismark does not have an indel calling function. We compared the calling of DNA methylation in BatMeth2 and Bismark with the calling from the 450&#x02009;K Bead Chip data. The results are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3B, where &#x0201c;BatMeth2-noIndel&#x0201d; corresponds to BatMeth2 with no indel detection. We can see that, in the absence of indel detection, the result of BatMeth2 was only slightly better than that of Bismark (with Bowtie1 as the fundamental mapping method). The result of BatMeth2 with indel detection was significantly better. Furthermore, we can see that BatMeth2 can detect more DNA methylation sites than BatMeth2-noIndel and Bismark (Bowtie 1). To understand why the performance of BatMeth2 with indel detection is better, we defined the methylation sites called by BatMeth2 as Result A, while the methylation sites called by BatMeth2-noIndel and Bismark were defined as Result B. Then, we let mclA be the methylation sites appearing in Result A but not Result B. We observed that mclA included 23,853 DNA methylation sites and 15,048 (63%) of the 23,853 sites covered by the alignments of indel reads called by BatMeth2 with indel detection (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3C). In addition, we found that the indel rates in Result A and Result B were only 5 and 0%, respectively. Hence, we concluded that accurate indel detection can improve DNA methylation calling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Visualization of DNA methylation data</title><p id="Par31">BatMeth2 provides tools to visualize the methylation data. To illustrate the visualization features of BatMeth2, we downloaded (1) 117 Gbases of single-end reads from the human H9 cell line, (2) 105.2 Gbases of single-end reads from the human IMR90 cell line and (3) 12.6 Gbases of paired-end reads from wild-type rice.

For such datasets, we used Fisher&#x02019;s exact test to discern differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs). For BS-Seq datasets with replicates, the most natural statistical model to call DMCs is beta-binomial distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

To facilitate the identification of DMRs from bisulfite data without replicates, we integrated Fisher&#x02019;s exact test to perform a hypothesis test. When a sample has two or more replicates, we use the beta-binomial distribution to perform differential methylation analysis. We also provide bed or bigWig files for the list of DMRs.

However, the complexity of DNA methylation analysis has hindered further research into the mechanism of DNA methylation in some diseases. Here, we discussed some difficulties and issues in bisulfite sequence alignment. First, incomplete bisulfite conversion when reannealing during the bisulfite conversion will lead to incorrect alignments. Moreover, sequencing errors, C-to-T converted reads and converted reference genomes further complicate the alignment of bisulfite sequences. These are the specific problems associated with aligning BS-Seq reads, in contrast to aligning normal genomic reads.</p><p id="Par41">In this study, we designed and implemented BatMeth2, an integrated, accurate, efficient, and user-friendly whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data analysis pipeline.
