The production of hexose 6 phosphate is a key node in different pathways that are required for a successful germination. Hexokinase (HXK) is the only plant enzyme that phosphorylates glucose (Glc), so it is key to fueling several metabolic pathways depending on their substrate specificity, metabolite regulatory responses and subcellular localization. In maize, the HXK family is composed of nine genes, but only six of them (ZmHXK4&#x02013;9) putatively encode catalytically active enzymes. Here, we cloned and functionally characterized putative catalytic enzymes to analyze their metabolic contribution during germination process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">From the six HXKs analyzed here, only ZmHXK9 has minimal hexose phosphorylating activity even though enzymatic function of all isoforms (ZmHXK4&#x02013;9) was confirmed using a yeast complementation approach. The kinetic parameters of recombinant proteins showed that ZmHXK4&#x02013;7 have high catalytic efficiency for Glc, fructose (Fru) and mannose (Man), ZmHXK7 has a lower Km for ATP, and together with ZmHXK8 they have lower sensitivity to inhibition by ADP, G6P and N-acetylglucosamine than ZmHXK4&#x02013;6 and ZmHXK9. Additionally, we demonstrated that ZmHXK4&#x02013;6 and ZmHXK9 are located in the mitochondria and their location relies on the first 30 amino acids of the N-terminal domain. Otherwise, ZmHXK7&#x02013;8 are constitutively located in the cytosol. HXK activity was detected in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions and high Glc and Fru phosphorylating activities were found in imbibed embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Considering the biochemical characteristics, location and the expression of ZmHXK4 at onset of germination, we suggest that it is the main contributor to mitochondrial activity at early germination times, at 24&#x02009;h other ZmHXKs also contribute to the total activity. While in the cytosol, ZmHXK7 could be responsible for the activity at the onset of germination, although later, ZmHXK8 also contributes to the total HXK activity. Our observations suggest that the HXKs may be redundant proteins with specific roles depending on carbon and ATP availability, metabolic needs, or sensor requirements. Further investigation is necessary to understand their specific or redundant physiological roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12870-018-1605-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hexokinase</kwd><kwd>Maize</kwd><kwd>Germination</kwd><kwd>Biochemical characterization</kwd><kwd>Cytosolic HXK</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial hexokinase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (CONACyT)</institution></funding-source><award-id>239605</award-id><award-id>25676</award-id><award-id>370274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera-Alvarado</surname><given-names>Giovanna Paulina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Facultad de Qu&#x000ed;mica, Universidad Nacional Aut&#x000f3;noma de M&#x000e9;xico</institution></funding-source><award-id>50009125</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencias y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (CONACyT)</institution></funding-source><award-id>252001</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par19">Seed germination, which starts with the imbibition, is a crucial event in the plant life cycle when metabolic activity resumes, and reserves are mobilized to support initial plant development. These are key steps to sustain the seedling growth before photosynthetic machinery lights up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. After germination, high content of hexoses 6 phosphate was detected in wild oat, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which indicates the activation of metabolism. Soluble sugars support the metabolic activity at the onset of germination, followed by the massive degradation of starch reserves and even the components of the cell wall at later times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Sugars are the main source of carbon and energy, but they also have signaling functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the dramatic changes of sugar type and concentration during the germination process undoubtedly regulates the enzyme activity and the pattern of gene expression of several enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Hexokinase (HXK) is a glycolytic regulatory enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible phosphorylation reaction of D-hexoses at the sixth carbon using ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> as a phosphate donor. The HXK family members, that can phosphorylate several hexoses, including glucose (Glc), mannose (Man) and fructose (Fru) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], can be localized at cytosol, mitochondria, nucleus or chloroplast depending of the presence of an anchor or signal peptide at their N-terminal sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The metabolic flux of substrates through different pathways, like the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), the fatty acid synthesis and nucleoside diphosphate sugar biosynthesis, depends on the localization of the HXK&#x02019;s metabolic products and other downstream metabolic intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, inhibition of germination in fenugreek, mung beans, white mustard and wheat seeds, was detected with HXK substrates like 2-deoxyglucose, D-mannose (Man), and D-glucosamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This, along with the low rate of germination of <italic>oshxk7</italic> null mutants under O<sub>2</sub>-deficient conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], reveals the key role that HXK has in providing energy and carbon skeletons to different pathways during this demanding process. Therefore, the expression of different HXKs at specific times and subcellular locations may contribute to control the metabolic flux during the germination.</p><p id="Par21">Regardless of its catalytic function, a substantial amount of research demonstrated that HXKs function as Glc sensors in plants. For example, in response to Glc abundance, HXK promotes the suppression of some photosynthetic genes, including the rubisco small subunit, carbonic anhydrase, sedoheptulose bisphosphatase, and the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although HXKs are the only enzymes that phosphorylate Glc in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], their catalytic activity has received less attention than their Glc sensor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Only a few HXKs has been characterized so far, some of them in subcellular fractions that could very well contain several HXKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We believe that due to its potential to eventually manipulate plant productivity, the study of hexokinase deserves much more attention. Unfortunately, the study of HXK families particularly in important crops is incipient in many ways.</p><p id="Par22">In maize the HXK family is composed of nine genes. Six of them (ZmHXK4&#x02013;9) putatively encode catalytically active HXKs. The other three (<italic>ZmHXK3a</italic>, <italic>ZmHXK3b</italic> and <italic>ZmHXK10</italic>), according to their sequence homology, encode proteins structurally similar to HXKs, but lacking catalytic activity, they are called HXK-like (HXL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. HXK activity has been detected in cytosolic, mitochondrial and Golgi membrane fractions of maize roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, based in gene sequence analysis has been suggested that maize HXKs might be located in the cytosol, mitochondria and chloroplast membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, we understand that the subcellular location and the number of enzymes that contribute to the total hexokinase activity in each cell compartment require clarification. Then the contribution each maize HXKs during a particular physiological process could be addressed. Elucidate the participation of a protein in any metabolic or developmental processes is difficult when mutants are not available. However, we hypothesize that the possible contribution of the six putative catalytic maize HXKs during the germination process, could be studied comparing their expression patterns, their catalytic parameters and they subcellular location. Besides, our study provides detailed molecular information on six HXKs that differentiate themselves by substrate specificity, metabolite regulatory responses and subcellular localization. This information helps us to understand how different HXKs could be involved in a physiological process like maize seed germination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identifying the maize HXK family members that have catalytic activity by in silico analysis</title><p id="Par23">To study the HXK maize isoenzymes that contribute to the metabolism on the germination process, and their evolutionary relationships between HXK protein families, 112 HXKs plant protein sequences were aligned using MEGA X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] using 2000 bootstrap. The phylogenetic analysis included two yeast HXKs sequences as an out-group (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 and Table S1). Since some HXKs are already characterized, we found that the HXKs were clustered according to some specific characteristics such as subcellular localization or lack of HXK activity. The maize HXKs were found in three clusters in the cladogram tree, ZmHXK7 and ZmHXK8 are related to the monocot HXKs, such as OsHXK7 and OsHXK8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Apparently, the mitochondrial HXKs are grouped in three subgroups: one mitochondrial HXKs in dicot plants, and two subgroups of HXKs in monocots, in the latter we found four ZmHXKs; ZmHXK4, 5 and 6 are in a subgroup different to the subgroup in which ZmHXK9 is. ZmHXK3a, ZmHXK3b, and ZmHXK10 are in the Hexokinase-like (HKL) group.</p><p id="Par24">The protein sequences of <italic>Zea mays</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> were further analyzed trying to visualize the amino acid differences between the putative HXK and HKL. The sequences were aligned using SeaView 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and information related to the tridimensional structure of AtHXK1 was used in the sequence analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A high degree of amino acid conservation in the putative domains, regions and conserved amino acids involved in binding substrates was identified in ZmHXK4, ZmHXK5, ZmHXK6, ZmHXK7, ZmHXK8 and ZmHXK9 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). In contrast, ZmHXK3a, ZmHXK3b and ZmHXK10, have several differences in the domains and residues that are involved in substrate binding in loop 2 and adenosine binding domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2).

Since the main goal of this work was to characterize the members of the HXK family in maize contributing to the seed germination metabolism, we focus on to clone the open reading frames (ORFs) of ZmHXK4, ZmHXK5, ZmHXK6, ZmHXK7, ZmHXK8 and ZmHXK9, and they were analyzed further.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of several conserved binding core domains, important to the HXK catalysis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice and maize HXKs.

Insoluble ZmHXK4&#x02013;6 proteins were detergent solubilized and renatured, but the enzymes recovered from this process did not show HXK activity.

There are several possible explanations for this effect. First, ZmHXK4&#x02013;6 and 9 may be inserted to the outer membrane of the mitochondria, a feature that could be relevant since the three hexose-phosphorylating enzymes are cytosolic in the wild-type yeast strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Therefore, a different subcellular localization of HXKs could affect substrate availability. Second, the complete version of the enzyme possibly aggregates in the cytosol and reduces its activity. Third, the HXK N-terminus could be embedded in yeast membranes in a different way than in the plant mitochondrial membrane, resulting in altered enzyme activity. Thus far, these or other possibilities have not been considered and remain to be understood.</p><p id="Par38">Conversely, the elimination of 30 amino acids at the N-terminus of ZmHXK9 demonstrated that this protein has enzymatic activity and is sufficient to allow for yeast growth in a medium supplemented with Glc or Fru as the carbon source. Therefore, ZmHXK4&#x02013;9 must be functional HXKs, even if ZmHXK9 shows a marginal enzymatic activity when is produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, then its physiological relevance remains uncertain. The low activity of ZmHXK9 could be due to the cooperative effect of amino acid changes, like the presence of many synonymous amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic channel of ZmHXK9 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2 and Figure S7) that could affect enzyme activity, even if the hydrophobicity of the putative proton channel is retained; 2) ZmHXK9 has six additional polar amino acids at the large domain near the hinge (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7). A longer domain could affect the flexibility of the hinge and reduce interdomain interactions between the substrates and the large and small domains; 3) the change of Pro<sup>133</sup>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Glu<sup>133</sup> (position relative to AtHXK1) and Gly<sup>310</sup>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Asp<sup>310</sup> (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7), which could increase the enzyme flexibility and affects Glc binding. Gly 310 is conserved in catalytic enzymes but it is absent in HKL&#x02014;such as AtHXL1, AtHXL2, OsHXK3, and OsHXK10&#x02014;and in the predicted ZmHXK3a, ZmHXK3b, and ZmHXK10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The metabolic responses to the substrate and product concentration combined with their subcellular localization might contribute to HXK activity and function. One reported classification recognized four types of HXKs in plants. We were able to differentiate between two types, cytosolic and mitochondrial HXK isoenzymes, using two methods. The first was to determine the effect of ADP, NAG and G6P. This allowed for us to differentiate two types of maize HXKs, one with high sensitivity to these molecules such as ZmHXK4&#x02013;6, and the other with low sensitivity such as ZmHXK7&#x02013;8. There is no information about the sensitivities of the enzymes in rice or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> for any inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, previous results using cytosolic and mitochondrial maize root fractions are similar to what we found in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The sensitivity to inhibitors together with the localization studies using the full and truncated version of each HXK confirmed that in maize, there are apparently only two types of HXKs: B and C. Type B HXKs have a membrane anchor amino acid sequence that directs the protein to the mitochondria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b,&#x000a0;Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). In maize, the type B HXK members are ZmHXK4, ZmHXK5, ZmHXK6, and ZmHXK9. Conversely, type C or cytosolic HXKs are present only in monocotyledonous plants and the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

The absence of a chloroplast HXK (type A HXKs) in maize suggests that Glc is phosphorylated by cytosolic isoenzymes and used in starch and fatty acid synthesis when night-time energy supply is limited in the chloroplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Either ZmHXK7 or ZmHXK8 could participate in these processes.</p><p id="Par41">The first 30 amino acids at the N-terminus in ZmHXK4, ZmHXK5, and ZmHXK9 are necessary and sufficient to attach these proteins to the mitochondria in addition to their role in modifying the enzymatic activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In maize, one HXK was solubilized from the mitochondria using the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS, demonstrating their integration into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Apparently, the large hydrophobic peptide at the N-terminus from plant HXKs is inserted in the outer membrane of the mitochondria in a manner different than mammalian HXKs. This difference was probably the reason for the high resistance to G6P to the clotrimazole drug inhibition shown by plant HXKs as G6P and clotrimazole induce HXK detachment from the mitochondria in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The role of the first 30 amino acids in ZmHXK6 is not clear because the low level of cytosolic protein that was found was accompanied by large fluorescence aggregates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). This fluorescence pattern was also observed in another type B HXK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">HXKs attached to the outer mitochondrial membrane are involved in numerous physiological processes given their strategic localization. This was suggested to represent an advantage over the use of ATP.

In potato, mitochondrial HXKs regulate ROS in tissues with an intensive oxidative metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

We speculate each one might play a different role in the cell that due to the variability of Type B HXKs in maize.</p><p id="Par43">During germination, the quiescent dry seed resumes its metabolic activity with water uptake, and the carbon source from embryonic tissues is required for completing the germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The transcripts for mitochondrial HXKs <italic>ZmHXK5</italic> and <italic>ZmHXK6</italic> were detected at low levels in dry maize embryos (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). They may participate in seed embryogenesis because they remain after the desiccation phase. However, at early stages of germination, the mitochondrial HXK activity was high, and it was maintained until 48&#x02009;h of germination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d), even though there is an increase in the oxygen uptake with the consequent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The activity of mitochondrial HXKs like ZmHXK4 that was highly expressed in embryos after 8&#x02009;h of germination could be important to the general metabolism. The high expression of <italic>ZmHXK9</italic> is intriguing since very low activity was detected for this enzyme, but its participation together with ZmHXK4&#x02013;6 cannot be excluded. This could indicate a metabolic and a sensor role. Furthermore, since the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> values) of the mitochondrial isoforms is similar (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), it would be difficult to use these inhibitors to distinguish their effects.</p><p id="Par44">In regard to the cytosolic HXKs, during the embryo development, two cytosolic HXKs show a considerable difference in their Km for Glc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. According to the kinetic characteristics and cytosolic localization of the recombinant enzymes analyzed here, the described activity of high- and low-affinity enzymes could be attributed to ZmHXK7 and ZmHXK8, respectively. During maize seed development, increased HXK activity coincides with the active phase of fatty acid synthesis. ZmHXK7 and ZmHXK8 could supply G6P to feed both the OPPP and fatty acid synthesis in the plastid to store reserves in the scutellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, the metabolic role during germination could be different since different metabolites are present. In rape, cauliflower, sugar beet, and radish, the content of ATP ranged from 0 to 0.2&#x02009;nmol/seed in non-imbibed seeds and rise to 0.3 to 1.2 after 3&#x02009;h of imbibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The high expression of <italic>ZmHXK7</italic>, an enzyme with a small <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for ATP and low sensitivity for ADP, may confer an advantage for the cell at early times in germination to start the hexose metabolism.

We demonstrated that ZmHXK4&#x02013;9 are functional HXKs. ZmHXK7 and ZmHXK8 are cytosolic proteins that phosphorylate Man and Glc, rather than Fru. Both enzymes have low sensitivity to inhibition by G6P and ADP with differences in their <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for Glc. By contrast, ZmHXK4&#x02013;6 are mitochondrial proteins that phosphorylate Man, Glc, and Fru with a similar <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for each hexose. Marginal HXK activity was found for ZmHXK9. At the N-terminus, in the ZmHXK4&#x02013;6 and ZmHXK9 sequences, 30 amino acids were required to attach these proteins to the mitochondrial membrane, and their presence modified the HXK activity. We also show that dry and imbibed embryos express different sets of HXKs. ZmHXK4 and 7 transcripts were detected in dry embryos, while at 24&#x02009;h of germination; the most abundant transcripts were ZmHXK5-9. Our results suggest that ZmHXK4 harbors the higher HXK activity detected in mitochondria. Likewise, ZmHXK7 contributes to the hexose phosphorylation at early germination times at the cytosol and together with ZmHXK8 at later times, considering the differences in their biochemical parameters we suggest that they may not only be redundant proteins but may also have specific roles depending on carbon availability, metabolic needs, or sensor requirements. Further investigation is required to understand their specific physiological roles as sensors or metabolite producers during various developmental processes using transgenic plants with gene knock outs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par47"><italic>Zea mays</italic> var.
