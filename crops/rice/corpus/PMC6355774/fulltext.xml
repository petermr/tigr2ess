However, the use of a single gene to impact several metabolic pathways is difficult. Here, we show that overexpression of the single gene <italic>SlMYB75</italic> (<italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE) is effective at improving multiple fruit quality traits. In these engineered fruits, the anthocyanin content reached 1.86&#x02009;mg&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fresh weight at the red-ripe stage, and these <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomatoes displayed a series of physiological changes, including delayed ripening and increased ethylene production. In addition to anthocyanin, the total contents of phenolics, flavonoids and soluble solids in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits were enhanced by 2.6, 4, and 1.2 times, respectively, compared to those of wild-type (WT) fruits. Interestingly, a number of aroma volatiles, such as aldehyde, phenylpropanoid-derived and terpene volatiles, were significantly increased in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits, with some terpene volatiles showing more than 10 times higher levels than those in WT fruits. Consistent with the metabolic assessment, transcriptomic profiling indicated that the genes involved in the ethylene signaling, phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways were greatly upregulated in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits. Yeast one-hybrid and transactivation assays revealed that SlMYB75 is able to directly bind to the MYBPLANT and MYBPZM <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and to activate the promoters of the <italic>LOXC</italic>, <italic>AADC2</italic> and <italic>TPS</italic> genes. The identification of <italic>SlMYB75</italic> as a key regulator of fruit quality attributes through the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes involved in several metabolic pathways opens new avenues towards engineering fruits with a higher sensory and nutritional quality.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Genetics: one small tweak, one giant leap for tomatoes</title><p id="Par2">A single gene has been identified in tomatoes that regulates multiple aspects of fruit quality, including levels of health-promoting anthocyanins, opening the door to engineering more nutritious and better-tasting tomatoes. Fruit breeders have long-manipulated genes to enhance traits like yield or disease resistance, but it is rare to find a single gene that can improve multiple aspects of fruit quality. In this study, Zhengguo Li at Chongquing University in China and colleagues show that over-expressing a transcription factor called SIMYB75 results in striking deep purple tomatoes enriched in anthrocyanins&#x02013;antioxidants thought to be protective against various diseases - which tomatoes are usually devoid of. They also had higher levels of other health-promoting phytochemicals and enhanced production of aroma volatiles, which can influence the taste and flavor of fruit.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFD0400101); The Committee of Science and Technology of Chongqing (cstc2014kjcxljrc0020).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">As an indispensable daily supplier of nutrition to humans, fruit offers abundant nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, improving the nutritional and sensory qualities of fruit is becoming a primary goal to meet consumer requirements for healthier food. Nevertheless, breeding efforts to date have primarily concentrated on yield and disease resistance traits, whereas sensory and nutritional aspects such as the pigment, aroma, taste and health-promoting compounds have not received sufficient attention. In recent years, tremendous advances in functional genomics and biotechnology tools have presented new prospects for producing high-quality fruits that can better meet consumer expectations.</p><p id="Par4">Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that are widely distributed in many plants, where they confer their typical appealing color to various tissues and organs in a number of species. With regards to their impact on human health, numerous studies have indicated that anthocyanins have high antioxidant properties, with the scavenging of active oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, anthocyanins have been reported to play a role in protecting against age-related degenerative diseases, especially by inhibiting tumor cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Anthocyanins are synthesized via the flavonoid pathway, which is a branch of the phenylalanine pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The accumulation of anthocyanins in plants is regulated by a series of environmental conditions and developmental signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Two types of genes have been suggested to participate in the anthocyanin pathway, (i) those encoding key enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and (ii) those coding for the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the spatio-temporal expression of functional genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Three types of TFs, R2R3-MYB, bHLH and WD40, are known to control the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, and most likely, these TFs work together through the formation of a transcription complex named MBW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, several studies have indicated that MYB TFs could also function independently of the MBW complex to regulate the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, thus assigning a crucial role to MYB factors <italic>per se</italic> in controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Tomatoes are one of the most widely consumed fruit crops in the world, which motivates their frequent use as a model species to study nutritional metabolism. Moreover, the tomato is an excellent candidate for the transgenic enhancement of its flavonoid content because of its low basal content of these compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Although tomato plants with both <italic>Aft</italic> and <italic>atv</italic> alleles could accumulate small amounts of anthocyanin, the mechanism and key genes controlling this variation have not yet been deciphered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The silencing of the <italic>SlDET1</italic> gene in tomatoes has resulted in altered light-mediated developmental processes along with an enhanced flavonoid content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, overexpression of the chalcone isomerase gene in tomatoes could increase the flavonoid content up to 78-fold exclusively in the peel, but the overall level in the fruits remained low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In contrast to the functional genes, manipulating the expression of TFs proved more effective at modulating the secondary metabolism. Lc and C1 are two TFs in maize that control anthocyanin biosynthesis; however, overexpression of these two TFs in tomatoes greatly increased the flavonoid content, but not the anthocyanin content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Overexpression of <italic>AtMYB12</italic> under the control of the fruit-specific <italic>E8</italic> promoter resulted in orange tomatoes that contained significantly high contents of flavonoid and caffeoyl quinic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, the most significant increase in the anthocyanin content of tomato fruits was first obtained by expressing <italic>Del</italic> and <italic>Ros1</italic>, two snapdragon genes encoding bHLH and MYB TFs, respectively, which were under the control of the <italic>E8</italic> promoter, resulting in fully purple tomato fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. More recently, crossing the <italic>AtMYB12</italic>-overexpression line with the <italic>Del/Ros1</italic> line was reported to enhance anthocyanin accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this study indicated that <italic>AtMYB12</italic> not only promoted flavonoid biosynthesis, but it also improved the carbon supply from the primary metabolism, energy and reducing power, which resulted in a larger aromatic amino acid supply for secondary metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. It is important to mention that the purple tomato fruits obtained in these studies always resulted from the cooperative action of two or more TFs. This result causes difficulty for traditional breeders, since it is challenging to find a wild species that could highly express these two or three key regulatory genes at the same time.</p><p id="Par6">Recently, the <italic>MYB</italic> TF gene <italic>Cs6g17570</italic> was identified to play a critical role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in blood oranges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the upregulation of its homologous gene <italic>AtMYB113-like</italic> resulted in the increased accumulation of anthocyanin in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, whereas its downregulation led to a reduced amount of this pigment. Moreover, this process was reported to be dependent on the MBW complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Through a homology alignment, we identified a tomato gene, named <italic>SlMYB75</italic> (SGN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://solgenomics.net/search/locus">https://solgenomics.net/search/locus</ext-link>) or <italic>SlAN2</italic>, which showed the highest sequence similarity with <italic>Cs6g17570</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>SlAN2</italic> was previously reported to improve tomato plant resistance to high temperature, cold and oxidative stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A recent study showed that overexpression of <italic>SlANT1</italic> or <italic>SlAN2</italic> induced accumulation of anthocyanin that was unevenly distributed in tomato fruit, but only <italic>SlAN2</italic> was able to act as a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in vegetative tomato tissues under stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. At the same time, <italic>SlAN2-overexpression</italic> fruits displayed an orange color, fast softening and higher ethylene content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, several other MYB TFs are also involved in some fruit quality attributes, such as primary metabolism, secondary metabolism and organic acid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and a consumer sensory analysis showed that there is a consumer preference for purple tomato fruits, for their better perceived flavor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, the potential role of <italic>SlMYB75</italic> in tomato fruit quality remains to be investigated.</p><p id="Par7">In the present study, we attempt to describe the physiological and metabolic changes in purple tomatoes produced by overexpressing a single SlMYB75 TF (<italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE). The data indicated that <italic>SlMYB75</italic> can effectively induce the accumulation of anthocyanin in various tissues, and its ectopic expression leads to increased ethylene production and enhanced phenolic, flavonoid and volatile aroma contents. Moreover, transcriptomic profiling showed that many genes involved in the ethylene response, phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways were greatly affected in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits. Using yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays, we found that the conserved MYBPLANT (AAACCAACCC) and MYBPZM (ACCTACCC) elements were the core binding sites of SlMYB75, and we revealed the ability of SlMYB75 to activate the promoters of the <italic>LOXC</italic>, <italic>AADC2</italic> and <italic>TPS</italic> genes.

The amount of aroma volatiles in fruits at the BR&#x02009;+&#x02009;5 stage was much lower than the levels at the BR&#x02009;+&#x02009;7 and BR&#x02009;+&#x02009;10 stages, and some of the aroma volatiles could not even be detected at the early ripening stage. Most of the volatiles showed significantly higher levels in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomatoes than those in the WT, including trans-2-hexenal, hexanal, 3-hexenal, benzaldehyde, 3-nonanone, methyl salicylate and geranyl acetate. By contrast, some volatiles such as 2-propyl-1-pentanol and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate showed similar or lower contents in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomatoes compared to the WT. Noticeably, the contents of terpenoids/terpenes, terpineol, (-)-4-terpineol, copaene, &#x003b3;-terpinen and &#x003b2;-myrcene in the <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits exhibited a dramatic increase, with some of them having more than 10 times higher levels than those in the WT, while the content in the WT stayed very low. Overall, the general trend is that volatiles in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomatoes are significantly higher than they are in the WT, in particular those corresponding to aldehydes and terpenes.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Aroma volatiles emitted by WT and <italic>SlMYB75-</italic>OE fruits at the BR&#x02009;+&#x02009;5, BR&#x02009;+&#x02009;7 and BR&#x02009;+&#x02009;10 stages.

could serve as direct targets of SlMYB75, we checked the ability of this MYB TF to bind the promoters of some of the DEGs directly using a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay. Since many DEGs were identified in this study, we chose highly conserved elements rather than specific DEGs to verify which ones could be directly bound by SlMYB75. By analyzing the promoters with the New Place database tools, we identified eight conserved elements as the primary ones present in the DEG promoters (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Tests on these eight conserved elements in Y1H assays indicated that only MYBPLANT (AAACCAACCC) and MYBPZM (ACCTACCC) could be recognized by SlMYB75 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), suggesting they might be direct targets of this MYB gene. To verify whether SlMYB75 could interact with native promoters of some DEGs, we performed dual-luciferase assays with genes involved in ethylene signaling and volatile aroma metabolism. The data showed that SlMYB75 could only trans-activate the promoters of the <italic>LOXC</italic>, <italic>AADC2</italic> and <italic>TPS</italic> genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Regulatory roles of SlMYB75 on the conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements and promoters of several DEGs.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, The interactions between SlMYB75 and eight conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements were determined by the yeast one-hybrid assay.

Anthocyanins are well known for their strong antioxidant and health-protection properties, but some of the most highly consumed fruits, such as tomatoes, are completely devoid of this compound. In the present study, we obtained remarkable purple tomatoes enriched with this health-promoting compound through the ectopic expression of a single SlMYB75 TF. Strikingly, <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits also exhibited higher phenolics and flavonoids contents and enhanced the production of aroma volatiles.

Given that it is difficult to find the parental lines that could highly express these two or three genes at the same time, together with its easy segregation characteristic, multi-gene strategies are not the best choice for breeders. Thus, expressing a single <italic>SlMYB75</italic> provides a straightforward strategy towards improving the fruit nutritional and sensory quality. In addition, the content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds was also greatly enhanced in SlMYB75-OE fruits, which is similar to the results of a study on anthocyanin-producing grapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyains are all derived from phenylalanine, and the transcriptomic data showed that most of the genes involved in the phenylalanine pathway were upregulated in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits.

However, our results indicated the seeds of <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomato were significantly smaller than the WT ones (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Previous studies indicated that plants that produce small seeds usually exhibit superior colonization abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and thus <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomatoes may have a better dispersal capacity due to their abundant small seeds. In addition, it has been reported that <italic>SlAN2</italic> overexpression confers enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses such as cold, high temperature, high light, and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

As an attempt to explain the two seemingly inconsistent features, it may be speculated that the higher anti-oxidative properties of <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomatoes could mitigate the ethylene effect, since the ripening process comprises a series of physiological and biochemical changes, among which the anti-oxidative characteristics have been suggested to play a fundamental role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">Aroma volatiles play a key role in the perception and acceptability of flowers, vegetables and fruits by consumers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This property leads aroma towards being the focus of horticultural research, but little is known about improving the aroma content through the transcriptional regulation of fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Consistent with the study in petunia flowers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, our results showed that the contents of the phenylalanine-derived aroma volatiles benzaldehyde and methyl salicylate were significantly higher in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits. Furthermore, the transcript level of fatty acid-related genes (<italic>LOXC</italic>, <italic>LOXB</italic> and <italic>LOXF</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and the content of most fatty acid-derived aroma volatiles, especially trans-2-hexenal and (z)-2-heptenal, which are important contributors to flavor and consumer acceptance of tomato fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, were greatly increased in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE fruits.

Interestingly, the terpene levels (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and transcript level of a terpene synthase gene (<italic>Solyc06g060180.2</italic>) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were also greatly upregulated in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomato fruits, suggesting that the isoprenoid pathway was also affected in <italic>SlMYB75</italic>-OE tomatoes. Studies on tomato mutants and rice indicated that there are interactions between the phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways, but the mechanisms underlying the interactions responsible for the production of specific metabolites are still unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. To explore the molecular mechanism of <italic>SlMYB75</italic> in promoting aroma volatiles, yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays were performed. The yeast one-hybrid assays revealed positive interactions between SlMYB75 and conserved MYBPLANT (AAACCAACCC) and MYBPZM (ACCTACCC) elements, supporting the idea that the CC(T/A)ACC sequence motif might be the core binding site of SlMYB75 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), in a similar way with that of AtMYB12 as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Consistent with this finding, the dual-luciferase assays showed that <italic>LOXC</italic>, <italic>AADC2</italic> and <italic>TPS</italic> genes with promoters containing MYBPLANT (AAACCAACCC) and MYBPZM (ACCTACCC) elements (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) can be directly trans-activated by SlMYB75 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Thus, SlMYB75 has a regulatory function and promotes aroma volatile accumulation, probably by targeting downstream aroma volatile-related genes.</p><p id="Par33">Overall, the outcome of the study indicates that overexpression of a single SlMYB75 TF can improve several tomato quality traits, including the sensory and nutritional aspects.
