## Location
We recommend that you copy the `ContentMine` folder tree onto your Desktop.

This will be 
```
$HOME/Desktop
```
for example:
```
/Users/pm286/Desktop
```
### Unix

### PATH for AMI
You will need to set your PATH variable to point to this folder. A typical MacOSX path will be:
```
$HOOME/Desktop/ContentMine/software/appassembler/bin

You may wish to set this in a startup file such as `.bashrc` or `bash_profile` depending on your system. Se precise instructions below.
