Although used in various ailments, validation of molecules for differential activities is yet to be fully analyzed, as about 80 % of the patents on this plant are on extracts or the plant parts, and mainly focussed on essential oil components.

(<italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic>) is an important sacred medicinal plant of India known as &#x0201c;holy basil&#x0201d;, <italic>Thulasi</italic>, <italic>Vishnupriya,</italic> and <italic>Tulsi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and worshipped for over more than 3000 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3"> 3</xref>]. This herb is popular in traditional medicine as &#x0201c;The Queen of Herbs,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;The Incomparable One,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;The Mother Medicine of Nature&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Being legendary sacred basil (Tulsi), is recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"> 6</xref>] not only for its sanctity, but forms an indispensible part of the traditional herbal medicine of East as discussed in Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita as well as Unani medicinal system. It is native to India and parts of northern and eastern Africa, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, and grows wild throughout India up to an altitude of 5900 ft (1800 m) in the Himalayas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The leaf of the plant owes a stronger, somewhat pungent taste than other basils due to a sesquiterpenoid <italic>beta-</italic>caryophyllene, and a phenylpropanoid eugenol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>O. sanctum</italic> has been suggested to possess anti-fertility, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-fungal, anti-microbial, cardioprotective, analgesic, anti-spasmodic and adaptogenic actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The chemical composition of Tulsi is highly complex, containing many biologically active phytochemicals with variable proportions among varieties or even plants within the same field. The volatile oil of leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] contains eugenol (1-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-allylbenzene), euginal, urosolic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], carvacrol, limatrol, caryophyllene, methyl carvicol while the seed volatile oil has fatty acids and sitosterol. In addition, the seed mucilage contains some levels of sugars and the anthocyans are present in green leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The leaf volatiles (terpenes and phenylpropenes) are synthesized and sequestered in glandular hairs present on the leaves, also known as peltate trichomes, which are the characteristic of lamiaceae members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Two types of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> L. are used for cultivation: (i) plants with green leaves known as Sri/ Rama Tulsi &#x00026; (ii) plants with purple leaves known as Krishna/ Shyama Tulsi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the quantity of many of its constituents can be significantly altered by varying conditions used for growing; harvesting, processing and storage that are not yet well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All of the varieties of <italic>Ocimum</italic> have unique and individual chemical compositions; but their medicinal properties are not yet explored completely. Despite huge importance of <italic>Ocimum</italic>, very little transcriptomic and genomic data of <italic>Ocimum</italic> sp. is available limiting studies on important phytochemical pathways. But comparative transcriptome analysis of <italic>Ocimum</italic> species (<italic>O. sanctum</italic> and <italic>O. basilicum</italic>) was recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This report correlated higher digital expression of phenylpropanoid/ terpenoid pathway genes of <italic>O. basilicum</italic> to higher essential oil content and chromosome number (<italic>O. sanctum</italic>, 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16; and <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;48). Also several cytochrome P450s (26) and transcription factor families (40) were identified which could be utilized to characterize genes related to secondary metabolism and its regulation.</p><p>Hence, there was a need to know about the genome of this plant to understand its metabolic potential, diversity, regulation and evolutionary implications. Here, we report the draft nuclear genome sequence of 386 Mb and the plastid of 142,245 bp sequenced with a composite next generation sequencing technologies. On the basis of assembly, 53,480 protein coding genes were identified.

Two libraries (long and short reads) of Illumina HiSeq2000, one library of 454 GS FLX and one mate-pair library of SOLiD 5500XL were constructed. Illumina libraries were used to generate the contigs and Illumina paired-end data along with 454 GS FLX single end data were used for contig merging as a result of which scaffolds were generated. While Illumina generated 45.37 Gb data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), 454 sequencing resulted in 320.3 Mb (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) data and SOLiD generated 12.68 Gb (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) data representing approximately ~130-fold coverage of the predicted <italic>O. sanctum</italic> genome. With the help of the two Illumina library data (short insert and long insert) the assembly showed significant improvement in respect of N50. Long- and short-paired end reads from Illumina deep sequencing was used to assemble a total of 107,785 contigs into 22,776 scaffolds. Super-scaffolding was performed in order to merge the existing gap-closed scaffolds into super-scaffolds using relative orientation of SOLiD mate pair reads. Finally, 9059 super-scaffolds of maximum length upto 2,211,552 bp were generated (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Out of the total super-scaffolds generated, 4159 super-scaffolds are larger than or equal to 1 kb in length (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The N50 length of contigs, scaffolds and super-scaffolds was found to be 12,769 bp, 61,854 bp and 303,233 bp respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The total length of the gaps in the assembled scaffolds was 26.11 Mb in a total of 3999 super-scaffolds. The total number of gaps present is 45,803 considering even the presence of a single N as one gap. The biggest gap identified was of 4906 bp in length. Mate-pair reads significantly closed ~60 % of gaps between scaffolds and five-fold change in N50 value and N90 value was also observed where N50 increased from 61,242 to 303,233 while N90 from 12,534 to 73,672. In order to validate the genome assembly, a total of 69,117 transcripts generated from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were mapped to the genome data and more than 95 % transcripts (66,891) showed 100 % coverage (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Process workflow of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> whole genome sequencing and assembly</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_1640_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Assembly statistics of contigs and scaffolds generated using the three sequencing platforms Illumina HiSeq2000, 454 GS FLX and SOLiD 5500XL</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>Contigs</th><th>Scaffolds</th><th>GapClosed scaffolds</th><th>Super-scaffolds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Contigs generated</td><td>107785</td><td>22776</td><td>22776</td><td>9059</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum Contig Length</td><td>115044</td><td>414711</td><td>411690</td><td>2211552</td></tr><tr><td>Minimum Contig Length</td><td>147</td><td>200</td><td>200</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Average Contig Length</td><td>3454</td><td>16984</td><td>16629</td><td>44354</td></tr><tr><td>Total Contigs Length</td><td>372395755</td><td>386828951</td><td>378759759</td><td>401803260</td></tr><tr><td>Total Number of non-ATGC characters</td><td>0</td><td>17898452</td><td>2665702</td><td>26110056</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of non-ATGC characters</td><td>0</td><td>4.627</td><td>0.704</td><td>6.498</td></tr><tr><td>Contigs&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 1 Kb</td><td>43174</td><td>14791</td><td>14769</td><td>4159</td></tr><tr><td>Contigs&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 10 Kb</td><td>11594</td><td>7544</td><td>7407</td><td>2357</td></tr><tr><td>N50 value</td><td>12769</td><td>61854</td><td>61242</td><td>303233</td></tr><tr><td>N90 value</td><td>2071</td><td>12742</td><td>12534</td><td>73672</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><italic>De-novo</italic> assembly of chloroplast and mitochondria genome data</title><p>The complete chloroplast (cp) genome of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> is 142,524 bp in length (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Specific pathway related genes identified or mined in this genome could be used for the production of secondary metabolites following synthetic biology approaches. Genetic markers can be developed based on these genome sequences for studies involving genetic map construction, positional cloning, strain identification and marker-assisted selection.
