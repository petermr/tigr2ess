The past decade has witnessed phenomenal increases in the incidences of asthma, asthma-related deaths and Glucocorticoids are the drugs frequently used (about 95%) in the treatment of bronchial asthma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Currently glucocorticoid dependent asthma presents a great clinical burden and reducing the side-effects of glucocorticoids using novel steroid-sparing agents is needed.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, the future therapies will need to focus on the 5-10% patients who do not respond well to these treatments and who account for approximately 50% of the health-care costs of asthma.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The surveys in adults show high prevalence of asthma symptoms and reduced lung functions particularly in lower socio-economic groups of the sufferers.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Asthma causes recurring episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. Common risk factors for asthma include exposure to allergens (such as those for house dust mites, animal with fur, cockroaches, pollens and mold),[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] occupational irritants,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] tobacco smoke,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] respiratory (viral) infections,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] chemical irritants,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] food allergies such as milk, peanuts and eggs[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and psychological stress.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] When airways are exposed to any of these risk factors; broncho-constriction will get manifested leading to inflammation. The airflow becomes limited and the patient suffers with the symptoms of asthma. The disease is comparable with <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic> type of <italic>Shwasa Roga</italic> in Ayurveda.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Ayurveda prefers a number of formulations to treat <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic>, which include few metallic preparation. <italic>Sameera Panaga Rasa</italic> (SPR) is an among such preperation, which is indicated in <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>SPR, an arsenal mercurial formulation is mentioned in <italic>Rasa Chandanshu</italic> in which <italic>Manahshila</italic> is not a component and later on it has been added by Ayurveda Aaushadhi Guna Dharma Shashtra. This later version has been accepted by Ayurvedic Formulary of India but, justification regarding the addition of <italic>Manahshila</italic> has not been provided. In addition to this; there is controversy regarding the final product, i.e., whether to collect <italic>Talastha</italic> or <italic>Ubhayastha (Galastha + Talastha)</italic>. Considering this, it is planned to prepare SPR with and without <italic>Manahashila</italic> and collect <italic>Talastha</italic> and <italic>Ubhayastha</italic> one and compare their respective clinical efficacies in <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of patients</title><p>For this study, 52 patients of bronchial asthma were registered from the out-patient department and inpatient department of Rasashastra and Bhaishajya Kalpana including Drug Research, IPGT and RA, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar.

The disease <italic>Shwasa</italic> has its root in the <italic>Pitta Sthana</italic> endorsed by <italic>Amashayodbhavaja Vikara</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Considering the aggravated <italic>Vata and Kapha, Acharyas</italic> have advised the use of <italic>Vata kaphaghna</italic>, <italic>Ushna, Vatanulomaka</italic> drugs as first line of treatment in <italic>Shwasa</italic>. However, adoption of certain specification is always required for the breakdown of the three pathways of <italic>Samprapti</italic>. Furthermore, drugs exhibiting quick control over vitiated <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Kapha</italic> are required during <italic>Vegavastha</italic>, while exerting action on <italic>Agni</italic> or <italic>Pittasthana</italic> along with <italic>Vatakaphaghnata</italic>. Hence, logically, the drug administered in the treatment of <italic>Shwasa</italic>, should be able to overcome <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Kapha</italic> for immediate and symptomatic relief but should also pacify the <italic>Pitta</italic> for relief. Vagbhata emphasizes that, a drug acts by its <italic>Rasa</italic>, <italic>Vipaka</italic>, <italic>Virya</italic>, <italic>Guna</italic> and <italic>Prabhava</italic>. Normally, the effect of <italic>Rasa</italic> is less than that of <italic>Vipaka</italic>. Effect of <italic>Vipaka</italic> is lesser than that of Virya, which further is lesser than <italic>Prabhava</italic>, provided all are present in equal proportions. The overall pharmacodynamics of SPR is <italic>Katu Rasa, Ushna Guna, Ushna Virya, Katu Vipaka</italic> and <italic>Kapha Vataghna</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] These dynamic actions are helpful in breaking the pathogenesis of <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic>. Asthma is now accepted as a T-helper type 2 lymphocyte-mediated chronic inflammatory disorder, characterized by airway eosinophilia and airway hyper responsiveness. Eosinophils appear to play a crucial role in the ongoing inflammation due to either an impaired clearance or a delayed apoptosis in the airways, where accumulation of a number of eosinophils cytotoxic proteins including major basic protein, cationic proteins and peroxidase could occur. As2o3 could alleviate the airway inflammation through promoting pulmonary eiosinophils (PE) apoptosis and lower PE infiltration. Low dose of As2o3 is proved to be effective with relative safety, it also has potential value in treating asthma.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In modern point of view SPR is Mercury-Arsenical (<italic>Ubhayastha</italic>) or Arsenical preparation (<italic>Talastha</italic>).</p><p>In preparation of SPR, <italic>Tulsipatra Swarasa</italic> (leaf of <italic>Oscimum sanctum</italic> Linn.) as <italic>Bhavana Dravya</italic> is advocated. Studies have been proved that leaf extract of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> is effective against arsenic induced toxicity. <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> has significant role in protecting animals from arsenic induced oxidative stress and in the depletion of arsenic concentration.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It has been proved that <italic>Ocimum</italic> extract can protect against mercury toxicity in mice. It significantly enhanced reduced glutathione, which is suggested that oral administration of <italic>Ocimum</italic> extract provides protection against mercury induced toxicity in Swiss albino mice.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Thus, Oscimum may help in nullifying possible ADRs of SPR.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, <italic>Nagavallidala</italic> (<italic>P. betel</italic>) was taken as <italic>Sahapana</italic> for SPR. Studies have proved inhibitory effects of <italic>P. betel</italic> Linn. on production of allergic mediators by bone marrow derived mast cells and lung epithelial cells. PE significantly decreased histamine and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factors produced by an IgE mediated hypersensitive reaction and inhibited eotaxin and IL-8 secretion in a tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and IL-4 induced allergic reaction.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Reduction of oxidative stress induced by free radicals by virtue of its anti-oxidant properties and chelation of heavy metals thereby minimizing its toxic potential and increasing safety margins were also found to be reported.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Considering all these, it is assumed that, <italic>Nagavallidala</italic> can reduce arsenic induced oxidative stress as well as the control of allergic diseases through inhibition of production of allergic mediators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results reveal that the SPR has a significant action in cases bronchial asthma and it could suppress total leukocyte count, eosinophil count, ESR and can improve PEFR along with providing symptomatic relief. Analysis of the data generated during the study shows that; all the groups of SPR have been highly significant in treating the condition. However, comparative evaluation shows that SPRMU group is better followed by SPRT and SPRU where SPRMT is less effective comparatively.
