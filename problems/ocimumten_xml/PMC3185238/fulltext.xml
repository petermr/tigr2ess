Introduction</title><p>In modern society, stress is a common problem faced by everyone in day-to-day life from different sources like job, family problems, pollution, noise etc. Stress is defined as psychological, physiological, and behavioural response by individuals when they perceive a lack of equilibrium between the demands placed upon them and their ability to meet those demands [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The level of stress depends on the threshold of each individual. Over a period of time the response to stress aggravates and leads to ill-health [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>The common symptoms of stress include fatigue, tenseness, irritability, apathy, sleeping disorders, emotional instability, thoughts, and concentration problems [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Present generation people are more ravaged by the consequences of stress than at any time in past, and financial expenses in terms of long-term sick leave due to stress-related mental disorders are extensive [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nearly 75% to 90% patient visits to primary care physicians are related to stress problems. In USA, health and efficiency costs of worker stress were reported to be between $50 and $150 billion per annum, and irrepressible stress revealed to be high risk factor for cancer and heart disease than either cigarette smoking or intake of high-cholesterol diets [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Psychological problems due to enormous workloads among employees have increased at a faster rate in many countries. In England, around 40 million workdays per year have been lost owing to mental and emotional problems [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. </p><p>Management of any unusual stress has acquired significant implications in daily life. Whereas complete avoidance of stress is unlikely, any intervention that facilitates elevation of threshold level can be beneficial. In order to curtail the economic losses towards the stress-related disorders and to improve the quality of life, traditional therapies seem to be promising alternatives. Indian system of traditional medicine describes remedies based on herbal supplementation, minerals, and other therapeutic procedures for enhancing physical and mental performance to evade the stress levels [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> Linn. (synonym: <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>), generally known as Tulsi or Holy Basil, belongs to family lamiaceae. In Ayurveda, <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> has been used for adaptogenic/antistress activity [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has been widely reported to possess antipyretic [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], antiasthmatic [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], antioxidant [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], analgesic [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. <italic>O. sanctum</italic> prevented reduction in the levels of brain catecholamine and monoamine oxidase and increase in dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in rats exposed to swimming and gravitational stress [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Despite the availability of extensive preclinical evidences on antistress activity of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic>, authenticated clinical data are found to be lacking. A study by Bhattacharyya et al. that revealed the promising effects of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> (500&#x02009;mg/capsule, twice daily after meal) for a period of two months in the management of patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) remains the only pertinent clinical evidence published on the medicinal herb till date [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Participants and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>The present study was carried out at two different centers in Lucknow, India between April 2008 and September 2009. Patients were recruited according to the inclusion criteria if they (i) were aged between 18&#x02013;65 years, (ii) had given written consent, (iii) agreed to come for followup at week 2, 4, and 6 irrespective of any relief or appearance of side effects, and (iv) were suffering from at least any three of the symptoms of stress shown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Patients were excluded if they (i) were unable to give voluntary consent, (ii) had history of significant cardiac, hepatic, renal, brain, or blood-allergic diseases, (iii) had physical disabilities, (iv) were taking allopathic or herbal medicines or participating in any other clinical trial, or (v) were pregnant/breast feeding.</p><p>One sixty-seven patients were screened for selection criteria, of which 158 were selected for the study after obtaining the written consent from each individual by the investigators. The study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Intervention</title><p>OciBest, an extract of whole plant of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> Linn. was developed by M/s Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India. The extract was ensured to comply with phytochemical specifications, namely, Ociglycoside-I (Hydroxychavicol glucoside/4-allyl-1-O-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-D-glucopyronosyl-2-hydroxybenzene; &#x0003e;0.1%&#x02009;w/w), rosmarinic acid (&#x0003e;0.2%&#x02009;w/w), and triterpene acids (&#x0003e;2.5%&#x02009;w/w). The composition adhered to the international quality requirements which included analysis of solvent residues, heavy metals, pesticide residues, and microbial contamination. The placebo capsules contained microcrystalline cellulose. Each OciBest capsule contained 400&#x02009;mg of actives. The placebo and OciBest were filled in &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; size blue-coloured, hard-gelatin capsules that could not be distinguished from each other. Each container was packed with 42 capsules and labeled with code number.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Randomization and Blinding</title><p>The patients enrolled for clinical trial were allotted to placebo and OciBest groups. To identify the patient code, a list of unique integer random numbers were obtained after generating the random allocation number using a computer-aided random series programme. According to the random allocation sequence, the distinct random numbers were mentioned in the respective containers (placebo or OciBest). The packed containers were dispatched from Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India to the study centers. The entire process was accomplished in concealed manner. As per enrollment and random allocation sequence the pharmacist dispensed the study intervention and was responsible for the same. The study investigators, pharmacist, and the participants were all blinded during the trial period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Study Protocol</title><p>The study was performed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. One fifty-eight patients were selected for the study and randomly assigned to placebo and OciBest group. Each patient was handed over one container and advised to take one capsule after breakfast and two capsules after dinner (total 1200&#x02009;mg of actives per day) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the patient was asked to report for followup and symptoms reassessment. Any unconsumed capsules were counted and recorded for compliance. Fresh container of 42 capsules was provided after recording the compliance. Similar process was repeated when the patient reported for followup during week 4.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Outcome Measures</title><p>The symptom scores of patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) were assessed on week 0 and thereafter followup on weeks 2, 4, and 6 of the study period.

Discussion</title><p>Current pharmacological investigations focus on alleviating symptoms of stress since physical strains and psychological pressures have become integral and inevitable components of present life situations. Recently, herbal extracts and supplements have gained global recognition for stress-relieving potentials [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in addition to popular medicinal uses and widely accepted safety profile [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. </p><p>The findings of a recent study proposed that people suffering from uncontrolled stress experienced impairment of short-term memory and other relevant functions in the prefrontal cortex induced by protein kinase C [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the current study, supplementation with OciBest significantly decreased the intensity of forgetfulness to about one-third observed in placebo group. Additionally, the effect size was found to be the maximum (0.70) which elucidated that the participants of OciBest group were highly improved from forgetfulness than from any other symptoms.</p><p>Sexual problems and stress are related in several ways. Psychological causes that arise due to work-related stress result in sexual problems. Excessive stress can lead to reduced libido/sex drive in both sexes [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our findings showed that <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> extract remarkably reduced the symptom scores of sexual problems by 87.5% in comparison to patients of placebo group. </p><p>In contrast to acute stress that accelerates neurotransmitters and hormones from the nervous and endocrine systems which in turn will enhance immune system functions, chronic stress aggravates exhaustion, distress, and disease [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present investigation, OciBest administration provided effective relief from frequent feeling of fatigue. Similarly, disturbances in regular sleeping habits are encountered with stressful life style. Also, daytime sleepiness has been reported with prolonged stress exposures [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results of the present clinical trial exhibited that the herbal intervention considerably reduced the intensity of symptom from 0.84 &#x000b1; 0.14 to 0.27 &#x000b1; 0.08. </p><p>The overall effects of extract of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> in patients with stress were found to be significant as compared to placebo which can be attributed to the influence of herbal supplement on four major symptoms like forgetfulness, sexual problems of recent origin, frequent feeling of exhaustion, and frequent sleep problems. The probable mechanisms of adaptogenic effects, from previously established studies, could be ascribed to neuroprotective [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], immunostimulant [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], free radical scavenging [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], nonspecific resistance inducing and plasma cortisol lowering [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] effects of <italic>O. sanctum</italic>.</p><p>The major phytochemical principles of Holy Basil largely contribute to its pharmacological actions. Saravanan and Pugalendi in 2006 reported that the triterpenoid ursolic acid at 20&#x02009;mg per kg per day for 30 days could be able to ameliorate the oxidative stress in rat heart induced by chronic ethanol intoxication by reversing the peroxidative damages and concurrently enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Another triterpenoid&#x02014;Oleanolic acid protected mouse macrophages against oxidative and electrophile stress [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>From the results of the present study, it is also evident that the severity of other symptoms such as headache, palpitation at rest, abnormal perception of hearing, blurring of vision, frequent GI symptoms, abnormal sensory perceptions, quarrelsome behavior, and avoidance of familiar people lessened to certain extent due to dietary supplementation. Although the scores of symptoms like abnormal movements of upper limb, tics, tremors, scratching, and missing appointments did not improve after six weeks of intervention, these symptoms are infrequently reported in stress patients. The positive trends of the present investigation can be corroborated with the research findings on <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> for stress management [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The different components of stress response include enhancement of central nervous system processes and the interaction between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Bhattacharyya et al. stated that, in human subjects, <italic>O. sanctum</italic> acts potentially in the regulation of HPA axis in stress-related disorders [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, analysis of study results also indicated presence of placebo effect to some extent which is commonly anticipated as a regular incidence in several clinical trials [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the critical observations on self-evaluated scores of study endpoints reinforce the fact that few symptoms in placebo group either remained constant (avoidance of even familiar people and missing appointments) or got aggravated (blurring of vision, abnormal sensory perceptions, and frequent sleep problems) from week 4 to week 6. </p><p>Pertinent to safety, OciBest administration was found to be well tolerated in stress patients and no adverse events were recorded during the clinical trial. Earlier research by Bhattacharyya et al. in GAD patients also confirmed the overall safety of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
